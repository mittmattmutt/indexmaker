[ . . . ] it leaves everything as it is” (1953:\nsection 124).¹\nother philosophers—across a range of subdisciplines—have advocated a critical\nand constructive philosophical project: we should not simply take our words and\nconcepts as they come, but should aim to improve them if we can. among the most\nprovocative of such attempts is sally haslanger’s social constructivist analysis of race\nand gender terms. haslanger proposes the following analysis of ‘woman’:\n¹ jackson himself would not endorse wittgenstein’s claim in full generality; he thinks that it is\nsometimes appropriate to replace one concept with another that can better do the relevant “theoretical\njob” (1998: 44). the point nonetheless stands that on jackson’s view, analysis is important precisely\nbecause it ensures continuity with ordinary thought and linguistic usage.\n    \n  '], [36, '36\ns is a woman iff\n(i) s is regularly and for the most part observed or imagined to have certain\nbodily features presumed to be evidence of a female’s biological role in\nreproduction;\n(ii) that s has these features marks s within the dominant ideology of s’s society\nas someone who ought to occupy certain kinds of social position that are in fact\nsubordinate (and so motivates and justifies s’s occupying such a position); and\n(iii) the fact that s satisfies (i) and (ii) plays a role in s’s systematic subordination,\nthat is, along some dimension, s’s social position is oppressive, and s’s\nsatisfying (i) and (ii) plays a role in that dimension of subordination. (2012a: 234)\ncall this claim (w) (and set aside the many interesting questions involved in working\nout the details). haslanger concedes that (w), construed as an analysis, clashes with a\nnumber of aspects of ordinary and expert usage and belief (e.g., given haslanger’s\nview, feminists should attempt to eliminate women (haslanger 2012a: 239)). but she\nnonetheless maintains that this is the analysis that we should accept—at least if we\nshare her broadly feminist goals, such as identifying and explaining “persistent\ninequalities between females and males” and uncovering how “social forces [ . . . ]\nwork to perpetuate such inequalities” (2012a: 226\x017), with an eye toward ultimately\nundermining these forces for the sake of social justice.\nanalyses like (w) are revisionary in that accepting such an analysis involves a\ndeparture from ordinary or expert usage and belief. but the idea that something\ncould be both revisionary and an analysis seems to stand in considerable tension with\nthe idea that analysis must be descriptive. this tension has led opponents of\nrevisionary analyses to the accusation that such analyses are changing the subject;\nroughly, the idea is that if our analysis is not describing current usage of, say,\n‘woman’, it must be describing an alternative usage of a homophonic word, a usage\non which ‘woman’ would take on a novel meaning. to take an example from popular\npolitics, proponents of same-sex marriage are often accused of trying to redefine\n‘marriage’, where the subtext of the accusation is that opponents of same-sex marriage\nare right about marriage, and proponents (presumably knowing this) want to stop\ntalking about marriage and start using the word ‘marriage’ to talk about something else.\na similar worrymotivates jackson’s emphasis on continuity with ordinary thought and\nusage; as jackson sees it, the alternative to descriptive analysis is stipulated change of\nmeaning, but such stipulation is of little philosophical interest:\nif i say that what i mean—never mind what others mean—by a free action is one such that the\nagent would have done otherwise if he or she had chosen to, then the existence of free actions\nso conceived will be secured, and so will the compatibility of free action with determinism [ . . . ]\ni have turned interesting philosophical debates into easy exercises in deductions from stipulative\ndefinitions together with accepted facts. (1998: 31)\nphilosophical discussion of revisionary analysis, from carnap (1956: 7) on, generally\ntakes for granted the idea that revisionary analyses change the subject in this\nsense. the controversy is only over whether (and when and how) it makes sense to\nadvocate for particular concepts, for particular changes of subject. thus proponents\nof particular revisionary analyses often see themselves as defending the replacement\n\n    \n  '], [37, '37\nof one concept with another (e.g., scharp 2013), and proponents of “conceptual\nengineering” and “conceptual ethics” present themselves as defending the idea that\nwe can study questions like “should we use concept c (over alternative a) ” (burgess\nand plunkett 2013a,b), and that the answers can inform our understanding of a range\nof popular and philosophical debates (plunkett and sundell 2013; thomasson 2016).\nin my view, the idea that revisionary analysis requires the replacement of one\nconcept with another, or with changing the meaning of our words, or with developing\nnew concepts, is entirely misguided. there is a perfectly natural sense in which one\ncan advance a revisionary analysis like (w) as an analysis of ‘woman’ as we have\nalways used it, the word and the concept that we have been employing all along—\nwithout changing the subject or engineering a new concept or anything of the sort.²\nthere is no conflict between the idea that such analyses are revisionary and the idea\nthat they are descriptive: they are revisionary, in that they depart from present usage\nand beliefs, but are still descriptive in that they are making a claim about what we\nmean now and have meant all along. further, there is a perfectly natural sense in\nwhich revisionary analyses might turn out to be correct—not that it might turn out to\nbe correct to adopt a new term or concept, or that changing the subject might be the\nright thing to do, but that (w) might turn out to be the correct analysis of ‘woman’ as\nwe have used it all along. (so it might turn out that women are subordinated not just\nas a matter of fact, but analytically, and have always been so—no matter how\nwidespread belief to the contrary may be or have been.)\nof course, none of this is to deny the obvious fact that we sometimes introduce\nnew terminology (or technical uses of extant terminology), and correspondingly new\nconcepts, in the course of theorizing. the point is that this is neither the only nor the\nmost plausible account of what proponents of same-sex marriage, or social constructivist\nanalyses of gender, or most other related debates are doing. a better\npicture—better because (as i will show) it better explains our epistemic engagement\nwith revisionary analyses—is that conceptual analysis can go beyond (and even\noverturn) extant belief and linguistic usage without changing of meaning, and\nwithout introducing new concepts. our theoretical activity shapes what we mean,\nbut it does so not by making us mean something new, but by shaping what we meant\nall along. so we are rarely if ever faced with two concepts and forced to choose which\nto use. we are often faced with new claims and new theories; we accept some and\nreject others, on good or bad grounds, and this plays a role in determining our\nmeanings and our concepts. but this is just part of what it is to be a thinker. there are\n² though haslanger (2012a) suggests that accepting (w) involves change of meaning, in more recent\nwork haslanger (2012b,d) agrees that revisionary theorizing need not be seen as meaning changing. in\nsupport of this claim, she appeals to the metasemantic views of schroeter, schroeter, and bigelow (bigelow\nand schroeter 2009; schroeter and schroeter 2009), according to which (as haslanger puts it), “interpretation\nof our own past linguistic practice with a term and the practice of those around us, together with\nempirical investigation, enables us to make judgments about how the term applies; the term refers to what a\nfully informed and rational judge in such circumstances would take herself to refer to. to the extent that we\nare informed and rational, we can know the correct application of the term” (2012b: 437). i am not\nunsympathetic to the spirit of this, and though i have significant doubts about the details, this is not the\nplace to air them. in the context of this chapter, i would insist only that there is no reason to think that past\nlinguistic practice (as opposed to the entire course of a linguistic practice, including its future) plays a\ndistinctive role.\n    \n                                              \n    \n    \n  '], [38, '38\nno interesting questions of conceptual engineering or conceptual ethics, over and\nabove questions about when we accept (or should accept) certain claims or theories,\nof the familiar sort long studied by epistemologists and philosophers of science, as\nwell as psychologists and philosophers of mind.\nthis chapter aims to clarify and defend these claims by developing an account of\nrevisionary analysis that makes sense of our engagement with revisionary analyses,\nand in particular, makes sense of the way we argue for and against them—our\nepistemic engagement with them. i begin by examining these arguments, and\nshowing that the view that revisionary analysis involves meaning change or concept\nreplacement cannot make sense of them. in section 2, i turn to haslanger’s proposal,\nand suggest that her view is best formulated in terms of competing analyses (rather\nthan in terms of competing concepts). section 3 develops the relevant notion of\nanalysis—a notion on which analytic claims fix the meanings of words. sections 4\nand 5 show how this notion can be developed to explain our engagement with\nrevisionary analyses. a key idea is that analytic claims can emerge in the course of\ndebate without change of meaning, so that our acceptance (perhaps late in the\ncourse of a discussion) of some analyticity can fix the meaning of a word as we\nused it all along.\n1. changing the subject\nconsider the view that accepting a sentence like ‘two men can marry each other’\namounts to changing the meaning of the word ‘marry’.³ as jackson might put it, the\nclaim is that the proponent of same-sex “marriage” says, “this is what i will mean by\n‘marriage’—never mind what others mean”; or perhaps better, “this is what i will\nmean by ‘marriage’, and others should do the same—never mind what we have\nmeant in the past”. if this is right, the proponent of same-sex “marriage” might go on\nto speak truly by saying things like “two men can marry each other”. but if someone\nthinks that a man can only marry a woman, she should not regard the proponent of\nsame-sex “marriage” as contradicting her. the proponent’s utterance of ‘two men\ncan marry each other’ does not express the proposition that two men can marry each\nother; she has not changed her belief in the falsehood of this proposition, but only her\nbeliefs about what sentences are best used to express it. her choice to use the term\n‘marriage’ in an idiosyncratic way does not change the facts about marriage, any\nmore than choosing to call a tail a ‘leg’ makes it the case that horses have five legs.\n³ the case of same-sex marriage is complicated by the fact that it was until recently a legal impossibility\neverywhere for two men to marry each other. but opponents of same-sex marriage—especially the kind of\nopponent of same-sex marriage who claims that proponents are changing meaning—tend to think that\nsame-sex marriage is impossible in a deeper sense (conceptually impossible), so that laws permitting samesex\n“marriage” must be regulating some state other than marriage. the claim ‘two men can marry each\nother’ is to be read as advocating the conceptual possibility of same-sex marriage; so (in the dispute i have\nin mind) the proponent of same-sex marriage is claiming that it would make sense to have laws that\nallowed same-sex marriage (and not merely same-sex “marriage”). this claim could be true even if samesex\nmarriage were legally impossible (though of course the proponent would presumably also advocate\nchanging such a law).\n    \n           \n    \n    \n  '], [39, '39\n(and of course this would be true even if the proponent of this way of speaking is able\nto convince everyone to adopt her usage.)\nif we are talking about legs, and i try to stipulate that ‘leg’ is to be applied to tails,\ni am trying to change the subject.4 if my stipulation succeeds and we continue to\nspeak of “legs”, then the subject has (at least partially) changed; we are no longer\nspeaking (just) of legs, but of tails as well. (if words are individuated by their\nmeanings, we are no longer using the same word; i have introduced, and gone on\nto use, a mere homonym of the ordinary english word ‘leg’.) when we say “horses\nhave five legs”, we should not take ourselves to be disagreeing with those who,\nunfamiliar with my stipulation, say, “horses have four legs”—except, of course,\nabout a matter of linguistic usage.\nlet’s say that an analysis that involves a change of meaning in this way changes the\nsubject. self-avowed proponents of conceptual ethics and conceptual engineering,\nand some proponents of revisionary analyses, tend to regard revisionary analyses as\nchanging the subject. call this claim the subject-change view of revisionary analysis.\nproponents of the subject-change view have made concerted attempts to explain\nsome aspects of disputes about revisionary analyses. for example, they point to other\ncases in which we have a sense of genuine disagreement even where it is clear that the\nparties are not asserting contradictory contents (e.g., “i like steve”; “no, you’re\nwrong: i hate him”). and they claim that in many circumstances, a primary purpose\nof an assertion may be to communicate metalinguistic information about how words\nare to be used (sundell 2011; plunkett and sundell 2013).\nthese observations are fair enough as far as they go. but there is a great deal more\nto explain. we do not simply express disagreement about revisionary analyses and\nleave it at that: we offer and respond to arguments for and against them. i claim that\nthe subject-change view cannot explain our argumentative practice: it cannot make\nsense of the kinds of arguments we offer, and the way we respond to these arguments.\nconsider, for example, disputes about same-sex marriage. one kind of argument,\ninvoked especially by opponents of same-sex marriage, appeals explicitly to the\nproper use of a word; for example, “we have always used ‘marriage’ to mean a\nunion of one man and one woman”. (this is, of course, enthymematic; the suppressed\npremise, apparently, is that we should continue to use the word as we have in the\npast.) call arguments of this kind—arguments that concern the use of a word, such as\n‘marriage’—metalinguistic arguments.\nalthough opponents of same-sex marriage do advance metalinguistic arguments,\nthis is not their only argumentative tactic; for example, they sometimes claim that the\npurpose of marriage is to produce children. this is (or at least seems to be) an\nargument about marriage (rather than an argument about ‘marriage’.) call arguments\nof this kind—arguments that concern something other than the use of a\nword—first-order arguments.\n4 it might be possible to form a theory that tails are legs; for example, perhaps animals with tails evolved\nfrom animals with five functional legs (so that tails are a sort of vestigial leg). in that sort of case, there need\nbe no change of subject. but that is not the case i have in mind; the case i have in mind is one in which\ni simply stipulate (without argument) that i will use ‘leg’ to apply to tails.\n    \n                                              \n    \n    \n  '], [40, '40\n1.1. the argument argument\nas a matter of methodology, we should look for an interpretation of these arguments\nand our responses to them that makes sense of what we are doing. of course,\nthere may be cases in which our arguments just don’t make sense—in which the\nparties to the debate are just confused or irrational. but in general, when a debate\nseems unconfused, we should try to understand what the participants in the\ndebate are doing in a way that makes them unconfused. in this kind of case, we\nwant to be able to say that the parties to a debate are rational, that their contributions\nto the debate make sense and contributes in a recognizable way to their aims.\nthis suggests two requirements on our interpretation of a debate about a revisionary\nanalysis:\n1. it must give parties to the debate reasonably good epistemic status with respect\nto the things they say. in many typical cases, this will mean that the parties to\nthe debate are saying things that they know, or at least justifiably believe, to be\ntrue. in other cases, the relevant epistemic status may be different. for example,\nif one party to the debate is attempting a reductio of her opponent’s position,\nshe should at least know or justifiably believe that what she says is a consequence\nof her opponent’s position.\n2. it must make assertions relevant to the debate. when a party to the debate\nmakes an assertion, that assertion should serve some purpose: for example, by\ngiving evidence for her position or evidence against her opponent’s position.\ni claim that no such interpretation of first-order arguments for or against revisionary\nanalyses is available on the hypothesis that such analyses change the subject.\nlet’s call the opponent of same-sex marriage o and the proponent of same-sex\nmarriage p; and consider o’s assertion of (1):\n(1) the purpose of marriage is to produce children.\nnow on the hypothesis that o is changing the subject, there are two ways of\ninterpreting this utterance, since the change of subject would mean that there are\ntwo meanings of ‘marriage’ at issue in the conversation. on one interpretation, o is\nusing ‘marriage’ in her own preferred way, to pick out a status that it is by definition\nimpossible for same-sex couples to enter into; call this status marriage1. on the other,\no is using ‘marriage’ in p’s way, to pick out a status that same-sex couples can enjoy;\ncall this status marriage2.\ni claim that neither interpretation can make sense of the debate. suppose first that\no is using ‘marriage’ in her own preferred way. then (let’s suppose) her assertion of\n(1) might well express a truth—a truth that o is in a position to know. so we are able\nto satisfy our first requirement on an interpretation.\nbut we are not in a position to satisfy the second requirement. for the proposition\nthat the purpose of marriage1 is to produce children simply does not bear on p’s\nposition. indeed, p may accept this claim; it is, after all, entirely consistent with the\nidea that ‘marriage’ should be used to mean marriage2. so on the hypothesis that o is\nusing ‘marriage’ to mean marriage1, her utterance of (1) just looks irrelevant to the\ndebate.\n    \n           \n    \n    \n  '], [41, '41\nsuppose instead that o is using ‘marriage’ in p’s way. this may seem like a\nsurprising way for o to behave, but it could make sense for o to take on p’s way\nof speaking for the sake of argument, in order to illustrate its consequences. for\nexample, if you try to stipulate that ‘tail’ be applied to all and only round squares,\ni might object “but then there are no tails!” in this kind of situation, my first-order\nobjection makes sense: i argue the way i do because i take it that you will be able to\nsee that what i am saying is a consequence of your view, and i think it likely that you\nwill regard this consequence as unacceptable.\nbut this cannot be what is going on in o’s assertion of (1). though (1), on this\ninterpretation, is something that p will regard as unacceptable, it is no consequence\nof her view. on the contrary: on the hypothesis that p is using ‘marriage’ to mean\nmarriage2, she should regard (1) as an obvious falsehood; moreover, it is an obvious\nfalsehood that is obviously not entailed by her position. so on this interpretation, o’s\nutterance of (1) fails to meet either of our criteria: it is an obvious falsehood that\no could neither reasonably believe nor reasonably believe bears any relevance to p’s\nposition, and it is hard to imagine any reason that it might make sense for o to\nattempt to use it in the debate.\nso the most natural interpretations of the debate on the subject change view fail to\nmake sense of o’s assertion. as the debate continues, we will find the same pattern:\nthe subject-change view simply cannot make sense of many of the argumentative\nmoves. so even if the subject-change view can explain the fact that disputes about\nrevisionary analyses involve genuine disagreement, it cannot explain how these\ndisputes are conducted: it cannot explain the way we argue. and—given that these\narguments really do make sense—this constitutes a powerful argument against the\nsubject-change view, which i call the argument argument.\n1.2. two responses\ni now want to consider two ways of responding to the argument argument. the first\nresponse has it that we are adopting too limited a view of the possible purposes of the\ndebate. true, o’s utterance of (1) will not convince anyone of a first-order proposition.\nbut there are other cases in which an utterance of an apparently first-order\nsentence primarily functions to communicate metalinguistic information. for\nexample, a person newly arrived at an antarctic research station may ask with a\nshiver, “is this cold ”; we could answer the question by pointing at a salient\nthermometer and saying, “this isn’t cold”. the thermometer is clearly visible: there\nis no mystery about the temperature, and no point in trying to communicate\ninformation about what the temperature is. our utterance—despite the fact that it\nis not overtly metalinguistic—functions primarily to communicate information\nabout how the word ‘cold’ should be used around here (sundell (2011); plunkett\nand sundell (2013); and see also barker (2002, 2013)).\ni agree that our utterances often communicate metalinguistic information in the\nway described; and i also agree that there is something metalinguistic going on in\nthe dispute: if i say, “two women can marry each other”, one of the purposes of my\nutterance is to communicate information about how i think the word ‘marriage’\nought to be used. but two points need to be made. first, even if our dispute is in part\nmetalinguistic, this does not entail (or even suggest) that the subject-change view is\n    \n                                              \n    \n    \n  '], [42, '42\ncorrect. it is entirely possible (indeed, common) for someone who uses a word with a\nparticular meaning to communicate metalinguistic information about how that word\nought to be used to someone who uses it with the very same meaning. (plausibly, this\nhappens every time i use a sentence to make an assertion: i assert the proposition\nexpressed by my use of the sentence, but i also communicate that that sentence is\ncorrectly used in these circumstances to express a truth.)\nsecond, it is not obvious how the claim that our dispute is metalinguistic helps us\nmake sense of o’s utterance of (1). this utterance does not bear in any obvious way on\nthe claim that ‘marriage’ should be used to express marriage2. even if we concede that\no’smain intent in uttering (1) is to convince p of a metalinguistic proposition, it is very\nhard to imagine any way that uttering (1) could reasonably be thought to aid in this\ngoal. so the observation that the debate is or could be in partmetalinguistic simply does\nnot help meet our second desideratum. even if the debate is metalinguistic, given the\nsubject-change view, advancing arguments of this kind just doesn’t make sense.\nso the subject-change view cannot make good sense of the role an assertion of (1)\nplays in the debate. the second response to the argument is to question whether\nmaking sense of the debate should really be one of our aims. perhaps arguments of\nthis kind are just confused; perhaps an utterance of (1) really would express either the\nobvious falsehood that the purpose of marriage2 is to produce children, or (more\nplausibly) the possibly true but irrelevant claim that the purpose of marriage1 is to\nproduce children.\nif this is what is going on, then we would expect p (to the extent that she is\nunconfused) to reply simply by pointing out the fact that o’s assertion of (1) is\nirrelevant. this is, after all, how a comparable debate would proceed in a case where it\nis uncontroversial that the subject has changed. for example, suppose i stipulate that\n‘leg’ is to apply to tails, and say “horses have five legs”; and suppose that you object\nthat horses have only four legs. to the extent that i am unconfused, i will not see your\nobjection as a threat to my view and i will not try to refute it; the right response for\nme to make is something like, “as you are using the term, i agree; but that fact—\nadmitted on all sides—does not bear on my claim about the preferred use of ‘leg’.”\ni admit that it would be possible in many cases for p to respond in something like\nthis way. (p need not actually agree that (1) is correct on anyone’s view of ‘marriage’,\nbut she could at least argue that its correctness is irrelevant to her view: “that may be\nso, as you are using the term; but true or no, it does not bear on my claim”.) i also\nagree that the subject-change view is plausible if this kind of response is made and\naccepted. (in my view, responding in this way goes toward making it the case that we\nare using the word ‘marriage’ with different meanings; see section 5 below.) but this\nis not the way debates about same-sex marriage typically proceed, and it is certainly\nnot the only way they can proceed. when confronted with (1), it is very natural (and\napparently rational) for p to feel a tension between this claim and her view. given\nthis tension, a typical, apparently reasonable response is to dispute the claim (e.g., by\npointing out that elderly opposite-sex couples can be married, even though they\ncannot produce children).\nnow perhaps the subject-change view can make some kind of sense of this\nresponse; the most natural suggestion is probably that p is adopting o’s way of\nspeaking in order to show that her view has absurd consequences, as in the “but then\n    \n           \n    \n    \n  '], [43, '43\nthere are no tails” case. but this does not fully explain the phenomenon, because it\ndoes not explain p’s reaction to o’s utterance, and therefore does not explain why\np responds in the way she does. in a typical case, p will feel that o has launched an\nattack on her view that puts her view under pressure; if o’s claim (1) is true, p thinks,\nher view has a real problem. so she feels obliged to argue against (1).\nthis reaction—the feeling that what has been asserted is incompatible with one’s\nview, so that one must offer first-order resistance—is something that the subjectchange\nview cannot explain. of course, it is possible that this reaction is grounded in\nconfusion—that in fact there is no such incompatibility, no such pressure on p’s view.\nno one thinks that debates over same-sex marriage are conducted under conditions\nof ideal rationality, and it is certainly possible that we make mistakes. but, as i have\nemphasized, this reaction is utterly normal. most participants in this kind of debate—\neven philosophers raised on a strict regimen of distinguishing use and mention—feel\nthat assertions like (1) constitute a threat to their view, and a corresponding need to\nengage in first-order argument. the claim that we are all so confused about what is\ngoing on is to be resisted as long as some alternative interpretation is available (and,\nas i will go on to show, one is available once we reject the subject-change view).\ni conclude that the replies to the argument argument fail: the subject-change view\nsimply fails to make sense of the way we argue for and against revisionary analyses;\nand even in those cases where the subject-change view has a partial story to tell, it\noften fails to explain the whole phenomenon.\n2. concepts\nlet me try to relate the way of thinking about the threat of subject change that we\nhave been developing to some things haslanger says. as haslanger puts the point, the\nworry is that when we have changed the subject “the term [ . . . ] expresses a different\nconcept than it did” (2012c: 394). the picture seems to be that concepts are or\ncorrespond to word meanings, so that distinct words (i.e., distinct word types)\nexpress different concepts. this way of putting the point suggests that terms always\nor at least typically express only one concept at a time (in the sense that for a given\nperson at a given time, there is a single concept expressed by all typical uses of the\nterm). but this would sit awkwardly with other things haslanger says about concepts.\nhaslanger distinguishes between two analytic projects (in addition to her own\n“ameliorative project”). one involves collecting our “intuitive” reactions to hypothetical\ncases and principles and trying to reach a set of principles that best systematizes\nthese reactions; haslanger regards this as producing an analysis of our manifest\nconcept—“the concept i thought i was guided by and saw myself as attempting to\napply” (2012c: 388). the other that involves collecting and systematizing empirical\ninformation about our actual classificatory judgments; haslanger regards this as\nproducing an analysis of our operative concept—“the concept that best captures the\ntype we are concerned with” (p. 387). one’s manifest concept can be distinct from\none’s operative concept, as the following example from jennifer saul illustrates:\nif we are investigating our manifest concept of democracy, then, we will probably arrive at a\nstandard that requires (at least) elections that are free of voter intimidation, the counting of all\n    \n                                              \n    \n    \n  '], [44, '44\nballots, equal access to polling places for all voters, and so on. [ . . . ] if we are investigating our\noperative concept of democracy, [ . . . ] we may well find that we apply the term far more\nbroadly than our manifest concept would suggest. it may turn out that our operative concept of\ndemocracy requires only regular elections and that all adult citizens be formally permitted to\nvote. this is compatible with substantial voter intimidation, great variation in access to polling\nplaces, and ballots going uncounted. we could find out that this is our operative concept by\nnoticing that in fact we apply the term ‘democracy’ even when we know that voters were\nintimidated, ballots went uncounted, and so on. (2006: 124)\nso on the one hand, haslanger thinks that change of subject involves using a word to\nexpress a different concept; but on the other, she thinks that words are often\nassociated with multiple concepts. and while this combination of views isn’t incoherent,\nit seems awkward. fortunately, the difficulty is not deep; resolving it just\nrequires some terminological regimentation.\ni take beliefs (desires, etc.) to be mental representations. there is a sense in which\ndifferent thinkers never share mental representations: my representations are in my\nhead, and yours are in your head. but there is another sense in which you and i might\nbelieve the same thing; we do not share a belief token, but we have a belief of the same\ntype. to say that a thinker possesses a particular concept is to say that she has mental\nrepresentations of a certain type.\nthere are many ways of grouping token representations into types—type-individuating\nthem, in the jargon—and different ways may be appropriate for different purposes.\nfor example, it may make sense to individuate mental representations in an\nextremely fine-grained way, so that different thinkers rarely if ever share concepts,\nand one’s concepts very often change over time, as one’s beliefs and inferential\ndispositions change (e.g., block 1986). but there are other purposes for which it\nmakes sense to individuate concepts in a less fine-grained way, so that a thinker can\nretain the same concept over time despite changes in belief, and different thinkers\noften share the same concepts.\none such purpose is tracking the kind of facts about certain kinds of agreement\nand disagreement, as well as closely related facts about successful communication\nand argument. we have already conceded that some genuine disagreements do not\ninvolve parties asserting contradictory contents, so that there can be genuine disagreement\ndespite difference in meaning; but we have also seen that disagreements\nthat support a full range of first-order arguments are not like this. the most natural\nway to make sense of these disputes will involve individuating concepts in a less finegrained\nway.\nhere is a simple way of developing the picture. suppose that you tell me, “fido is a\ndog”. you are expressing a certain belief—a mental representation of a particular\ntype—and i understand you only if i entertain a mental representation of the same\ntype. if i believe you, i am justified only if the mental representation i form is a\nrepresentation of the same type you expressed (at least in typical cases). my utterance\nof “fido is a dog” expresses or constitutes agreement with your utterance of the samesounding\nsentence just in case the two utterances are expressing beliefs of the same\ntype. and so on.\n    \n           \n    \n    \n  '], [45, '45\nsimilar sorts of points can be made even if we are paying attention to a single\nthinker. if at one time i say, “fido is a dog”, but at a later time i say, “fido is not a\ndog”, have i changed my mind  the answer depends on whether i reject at the later\ntime a thought of the type that i had earlier accepted, and this amounts to whether\n‘fido’ and ‘dog’ (and perhaps also ‘is’ and ‘a’) express the same concepts in both\nutterances. if i am inclined to say both “fido is a dog” and “fido is not a dog” at the\nsame time, am i incoherent  again, the answer depends on what types of belief\ni would express by these sentences.\nif we want concepts to do this kind of work, we have to individuate them so that\nthinkers can have the same concepts over time and across changes of view. i may\ndisagree with an interlocutor about many weighty matters, matters central to our\ndiscussion; i may despite this understand her, and agree with much of what she says.\nthis requires that we share concepts of the same type. i may change some of my\nbeliefs on a given topic while still retaining others, and again this requires individuating\nconcepts in such a way that i can retain concepts of the same type despite my\nchange of view.\nlet’s not dispute whether there are other ways of treating these phenomena; i am\nhappy to concede that there could be. there are, after all, many ways of individuating\nmental representations. our purpose now is simply to lay out some stipulations\nabout one useful way of using the word ‘concept’; i am stipulating that concepts are\nindividuated in at least a somewhat coarse-grained way, and indicating (admittedly\nroughly) how the individuation is to go.\nif we are individuating concepts in this way, then we should not think of the\nmanifest “concept” and the operative “concept” as being distinct concepts (at least in\ntypical cases). if they were, then we should see no conflict between our judgment that\ndemocracy requires that all citizens have equal access to polling places, and our\njudgment that (say) the usa is a democracy, even if we discover that many regions of\nthe usa have enacted voter identification laws specifically designed to reduce the\nability of certain groups to vote. since my judgments about the theoretical principle\n(which brings to bear my “manifest concept”) and my judgment about the usa (which\nbrings to bear my “operative concept”) involve different concepts, there is no inconsistency\nbetween them. we could simply rest content with our view.\nit is quite possible that some cases fit this model. but the most natural understanding\nof the “democracy” case does not seem like this. if we judge that the usa is\na democracy, but fails to meet some of the general conditions we judge necessary for\ndemocracy, this would generate a real feeling of conflict. the judgments just seem\ninconsistent. anyone who finds themselves in this position and fails to take steps to\nreconcile her view—coming to believe that the usa is not a democracy, modifying\nthe principle that democracy requires equal access, etc.—is pro tanto irrational.\nso if the result of an “analysis of our manifest concept of democracy” and the result\nof an “analysis of our operative concept of democracy” are not analyses of distinct\nconcepts, what are they  on the way of individuating concepts that we are now\nconsidering, we should think of these not as analyses of different concepts, but as\ncompeting proposed analyses of one and the same concept. to get clear on why this\nmakes sense, we will need to turn to the notion of analysis.\n    \n                                              \n    \n    \n  '], [46, '46\n3. analyticity\nhaslanger proposes (w) as an analysis of ‘woman’, and i take it that this proposal\nentails that (w) is an analytic truth.5 but what exactly does it mean for a claim to be\nanalytic, or to be proposed as an analysis \nanalysis and analyticity came under heavy scrutiny after quine’s (1953, 1966a,b)\ncritique. traditional accounts of analyticity combined metaphysical and epistemological\nelements, usefully distinguished by boghossian as follows:\nepistemic analyticity a sentence s is epistemically analytic iff “mere grasp of s’s\nmeaning by t suffice[s] for t’s being justified in holding s true”. (1997: 334)\nmetaphysical analyticity a sentence s is metaphysically analytic if “in some\nappropriate sense, it owes its truth-value completely to its meaning, and not at\nall to ‘the facts’”. (1997: 334)\nit’s hard to see how metaphysical analyticity could be relevant to revisionary analyses\n(like haslanger’s), and that’s a good thing: with boghossian and most others, i take\nquine’s attack on metaphysical analyticity to have been decisive. our meaning that\nhesperus is hesperus by “hesperus is hesperus” doesn’t make it the case that\nhesperus is hesperus; what makes it the case that hesperus is hesperus is a thoughtand\nlanguage-independent fact.\nboghossian himself defends epistemic analyticity, and although this cannot be the\nright account of what it is to be analytic in the sense relevant to our debate—manifest\nanalyses, for example, will typically be known on the basis of empirical investigation,\nnot justifiably believable by anyone who grasps them—investigating boghossian’s\ncase will help reveal another element in notion of analyticity that will provide a\nframework for understanding revisionary analyses like haslanger’s.\nthe foundation of boghossian’s defense of epistemic analyticity is a view about\nwhat it takes to possess certain concepts, such as the concepts of geometry: “grasp of\nthe indefinables of geometry consists precisely in the adoption of one set of truths\ninvolving them” (1997: 348). more generally:\nadoption grasp a term t is grasped by adoption (or a-grasped) just in case there is\nsome set of truths s which is such that one understands t iff one accepts each\nmember of s.\nboghossian’s main interest is in logic; there, his idea is that (e.g.) one possesses the\nconcept of conjunction just in case one accepts principles like, “if p and q, then p”. he\nclaims that this account of grasp “generates” (1997: 348) the following account of\nhow logical constants get their meanings:\nit is by arbitrarily stipulating that certain sentences of logic are to be true, or that certain\ninferences are to be valid, that we attach a meaning to the logical constants. more specifically, a\nparticular constant means that logical object, if any, which would make valid a specified set of\nsentences and/or inferences involving it. (1997: 348)\n5 i will also extend the term ‘analytic’ to obvious entailments of analyses, so that (e.g.) if (w) is an\nanalysis, then it is an analytic truth that women are oppressed).\n    \n           \n    \n    \n  '], [47, '47\nwe can generalize the proposal in the following way:\nimplicit definition a term t is implicitly defined iff we attach a meaning to t by\narbitrarily stipulating that certain sentences involving t are to be true. more\nspecifically, t has that meaning, if any, which would make true a specified set of\nsentences involving it.\nif implicit definition is true, then there is a sense in which certain sentences are true\nby convention. but boghossian argues convincingly that there is no threat that\nimplicit definitions will result in conventional truths of the sort that quine’s arguments\nshow to be problematic. perhaps the simplest way to see the point is on the\nview that propositions—the meanings of sentences—are the primary truth bearers, so\nthat a sentence is true only if it expresses a true proposition. we can imagine\npropositions having their truth values fixed antecedently to any human linguistic\nactivity. stipulation makes it the case that a particular sentence expresses a particular\nproposition; it does not make it the case that the proposition expressed by the\nsentence is true.\nconsider an example. suppose that the length of a certain rod r is l, so that the\nproposition that the length of r is l is true (and true independently of human thought\nand linguistic activity). then we can introduce the term ‘meter’ by stipulating: “the\nlength of r is one meter”. given the meanings of the other words in the sentence\n(‘the’, ‘length’, ‘of ’, etc.), the syntactic structure of the sentence, and the composition\nrules of the language, there are a variety of propositions that the sentence might\nexpress, depending on what ‘meter’ means: the proposition that the length of r is h,\nthe proposition that the length of r is l, the proposition that the length of r is m, etc.\nby stipulating that “the length of r is one meter” expresses a truth, we fix on a\nparticular candidate—the only true candidate in the vicinity: the proposition that the\nlength of r is l. this in turn fixes the meaning of ‘meter’: given the extant meanings of\n‘the’, ‘length’, etc., and the facts about syntax and composition, “the length of r is\none meter” expresses the proposition that the length of r is l only if ‘meter’ picks out l.\nit is clear in this example that our linguistic stipulations have not made true any\nnon-linguistic facts. the facts about length were fixed prior to our stipulation.\nsomething like this model of implicit definition provides the foundation of what\nwe will develop in what follows. but in order to avail ourselves of this foundation, we\nwill need to rethink what it takes to grasp the meaning of an implicitly defined term,\nas well as the notion of stipulation.\n3.1. implicit definition and adoption grasp\nimplicit definition would fit neatly with adoption grasp. but the two are in principle\nseparable; an implicit definition-style account of how words get their meaning is\ncompatible with any number of accounts of how meaning can be grasped.\nhere is an example. consider kripke’s (1980) causal picture of meaning: a word is\nintroduced at an initial baptism, and later uses get their meaning in virtue of their\nconnection to this initial baptism. a typical instance of such a baptism might\ninvolve pointing at a certain baby and saying something like, “i hereby name this\nbaby ‘ansel’”. this is an arbitrary stipulation that attaches a meaning to the word\n‘ansel’. but it does not exactly fit the template described in implicit definition, since\n    \n                                              \n    \n    \n  '], [48, '48\nwe are not stipulating that any sentence is true. so let’s reformulate our initial\nbaptism: “i hereby stipulate that the following sentence is true: ‘the baby in room\n110, ninewells hospital, at 10:00am gmt 25th april 2013, is ansel’”. plausibly,\nthen, the meaning of ‘ansel’ has been fixed by arbitrarily stipulating that a certain\nsentence involving ‘ansel’ is true. so ‘ansel’ is implicitly defined.\nbut note that this does not entail that adoption grasp is true of ‘ansel’. on the\ncontrary: kripke’s view has it that later speakers grasp ‘ansel’ in virtue of their causal\nconnection to the initial baptism. he specifically rejects the idea that speakers’\ncompetence with a term depends on entertaining the stipulation with which a\nword is introduced. so a word can be implicitly defined but not a-grasped.\nit might be objected at this point that on kripke’s story, the meaning of ‘ansel’ as it\nis used by later speakers is not determined solely by the stipulation. instead, it is\ndetermined by the stipulation and the later speakers’ causal connection to that\nstipulation. if that is right, then ‘ansel’ is not implicitly defined.\nthis is a fair point. in general, we should allow that a stipulation can play a\nsignificant role in fixing the meaning of a word, while also allowing that other factors\nmay also play a role. so we should allow for the possibility that stipulation partially\nfixes the meaning of a word, while other factors also play a role:\npartial implicit definition a term t is p-implicitly defined iff t has the meaning it\ndoes at least in part in virtue to an arbitrary stipulation that certain sentences\ninvolving t are to be true. more specifically, if t has a meaning, it has a meaning\nwhich would make true a specified set of sentences involving it.\nwhat we have established so far, then, is that partial implicit definition and adoption\ngrasp can come apart, at least in principle; a term can be p-implicitly defined but not\na-grasped. and this is a good thing: boghossian’s defence of epistemic analyticity has\ncome under sustained attack, notably in the work of timothy williamson (2006,\n2007). williamson points out that experts with idiosyncratic theoretical views can\ndissent from even the most basic and plausible truths involving a word. for example,\nwilliamson suggests that a thinker might reject an elementary logical truth like\n“every vixen is a vixen”—an instance of a principle acceptance of which might well\nbe held to be constitutive of understanding of ‘every’—because she maintains that ‘every’\nhas existential import, and denies that there are vixens. similarly, williamson points to\nlogicians who reject modus ponens. such thinkers seem to be counterexamples to the\nclaim that logical terminology is a-grasped: these experts seem to understand ‘every’ and\n‘if ’, while rejecting principles in which this understanding putatively consists.\nthere have been, of course, a variety of attempts to resist williamson’s examples\n(e.g., boghossian 2011); but i, for one, continue to find the examples convincing. but\nthere is need for care. williamson’s examples refute the claim that adoption grasp\nis true of words like ‘every’ and ‘if ’. they do not refute the claim that these words are\np-implicitly defined. for example, one could imagine a kripke-style view on which\n‘if ’ means what it does because of our causal connection to an ancient stipulation.\n(i do not claim that this is a plausible story, only that it is unscathed by williamson’s\nexamples.)\nthe crucial lesson of kripke’s causal theory, for our purposes, is just that the\nstipulation that p-implicitly defines a word need not be grasped (known, believed,\n    \n           \n    \n    \n  '], [49, '49\nentertained) by competent users of the term. the meanings of my words can be fixed\nby stipulations that are spatially and temporally distant from me—stipulations that\ni am in no position to know of.\n3.2. from implicit definition to metasemantic analyticity\na further thread in quine’s critique is that the notion of analyticity is unclear, and\nthat attempts to clarify or explain it are either circular or rely on equally unclear\nnotions of meaning or synonymy. carnap’s response was to offer an account that\nsuited the formal languages that are the primary focus of his meaning and necessity\n(1956).6 in developing such a formal language, we may stipulate that certain sentences\nare to be regarded as meaning postulates. carnap’s idea is that a sentence is\nanalytic just in case it is entailed by the set of meaning postulates.\ncarnap’s use of meaning postulates is meant to ground metaphysical analyticities:\nanalyticity is understood as truth in virtue of meaning. but meaning postulates were\nalso taken up by proponents of montague grammar in the 1970s and 1980s (see, e.g.,\nmontague 1974: 212\x0113; dowty et al. 1981: 224\x015). in these works, the metaphysical\nambitions have largely dropped away. the role of meaning postulates is to help to\nfix the meaning of certain terms. the basic idea is simple. in montague grammar,\nexpressions are assigned semantic values relative to a model. to say that a certain\nsentence is a meaning postulate is to say that we will only consider models that make\nthat sentence true. since logical truth is defined as truth at every model, meaning\npostulates will be logical truths.\nlet’s consider a simplified example. suppose that the semantic values of one-place\npredicates are sets of individuals (the individuals of which the predicate is true), so\nthat a sentence like (2) is true if and only if the semantic value of ‘bachelor’ is a subset\nof the semantic value of ‘unmarried’:\n(2) for all x, if x is a bachelor then x is unmarried\nby letting (2) be a meaning postulate, we restrict our attention to models relative to\nwhich the sentence is true, so models relative to which semantic value of ‘bachelor’ is\na subset of the semantic value of ‘unmarried’. the idea is that although this does not\ncompletely determine the meanings of ‘bachelor’ and ‘unmarried’, it puts a constraint\non, and so partially fixes, them.\nthe traditional metaphysical notion of analyticity had it that some sentences were\ntrue in virtue of their meanings. the use of meaning postulates that we are now\nconsidering flips this on its head: some expressions have the meanings they do in\nvirtue of our holding certain sentences true. instead of truth in virtue of meaning, we\nhave meaning in virtue of truth: by stipulating that we will only consider interpretations\nof our words that make a certain sentence true, we have put a constraint on,\nhence partially determined, the meanings of the words that compose that sentence.\nit is no accident if meaning postulates remind one of partial implicit definitions.\nthey play an extremely similar role; in effect, meaning postulates p-implicitly define\n6 carnap characterizes his project here as explication, which he sees as involving the replacement of one\nconcept by another; but (of course) on my view we need not accept this characterization.\n    \n                                              \n    \n    \n  '], [50, '50\nthe words that compose them. i suggest that sentences that p-implicitly define\n(some of) the words that compose them deserve to be thought of as analytic in the\nfollowing sense:\nmetasemantic analyticity a sentence is metasemantically analytic with respect to\na word (or a use of a word) iff the meaning of that (use of the) word is partially\nfixed by the stipulation that the sentence is to be true (i.e., iff the sentence\np-implicitly defines the word).\nmetasemantic analyticity has, perhaps, received less attention in the literature on\nanalyticity than epistemic and metaphysical analyticity, in part because it plays a less\nimportant role in the metaphysical and epistemological debates to which analyticity\nhas often been turned (e.g., there is no clear role for metasemantic analyticity in\ngiving an account of metaphysical modality, or of a priori knowledge). but there is\nnonetheless a notable tradition of using the word ‘analyticity’ to pick out metasemantic\nanalyticity. meaning postulates are, after all, what is analytic on carnap’s\naccount, and one of their primary roles (the role picked up on by montagovians) is to\nfix meaning. and metasemantic analyticity is the notion most relevant to the many\ndiscussions of analyticity in the work of fodor and his collaborators. to take just one\nrepresentative example, fodor and pylyshyn write, “analytic beliefs can’t be revised\nwithout changing the content of (some or all of ) their conceptual constituents; that\nis, they can’t be changed without equivocating” (2015: 57). this passage only makes\nsense if what is at issue is something like metasemantic analyticity (applied to beliefs\nand the representations that compose them rather than to natural language sentences\nand words): the idea is that some of our beliefs determine the content of their\nrepresentational constituents, so that changing these beliefs would correspondingly\nchange the content of the constituents. what is at issue is how the contents of\ncertain mental representations are determined: that is, the metasemantics of those\nrepresentations.\nso there is an established pattern of using ‘analyticity’ to pick out metasemantic\nanalyticities in the literature. on my view, proposed revisionary analyses, such as\nhaslanger’s (w), should be seen as attempts at metasemantic analysis.\n4. timing\nlet’s pause to take stock. i began by showing that the subject-change view cannot\nexplain how we argue for revisionary analyses, and i have now developed the notion\nof metasemantic analyticity, which i claim to be relevant to revisionary analysis. but\nat this point it may be unclear how my rejection of the subject-change view can be\nreconciled with my embrace of metasemantic analyticity. for isn’t the proponent of\nthe subject-change model precisely endorsing the claim that revisionary analyses are\na kind of stipulation that introduces a new meaning for a word (and hence changes\nthe subject)  after all, what makes it the case that post-revision uses of the word have\na different meaning  surely it is the revisionary analysis—the stipulation—but that is\njust to say that the revisionary analysis partially fixes the meaning of the word and so\nis metasemantically analytic.\n    \n           \n    \n    \n  '], [51, '51\ni propose to grant that revisionary analyses—if successful—are metasemantically\nanalytic. (we will return momentarily to the question of what makes a revisionary\nanalysis successful when it is.) but we can grant this without embracing the subjectchange\nview. on the subject continuity model that i advocate, there is no new\nmeaning; a successful stipulation fixes the meaning of the word as it was used all\nalong.\nit must be admitted that the subject-change view would fit well with our standard\nconception of stipulation. stipulated definitions are typically thought of as coming\nwhen a word is first introduced. but what motivates this conception  one possible\nmotivation comes from adoption grasp: if users of a word must grasp the stipulated\ndefinition, then the stipulation must occur before the word is used. but as we have\nseen, there are popular and plausible views on which p-implicit definition (and hence\nmetasemantic analyticity) can be prised apart from adoption grasp. on these views,\nthe stipulation that p-implicitly defines a word can be made by an unknown person\nin the distant past, and the stipulation need not be known by current users of the\nword as long as they are causally connected to it in the right way. so users of a word\nneed not accept the sentence that p-implicitly defines that word; a word i use can get\nits meaning (at least in part) from a stipulation made by someone else, of which i am\nnot even aware.\nthe subject continuity view is a development of this idea. although the kripkean\ncausal picture rejects the view that users of a term must grasp the stipulation that\nintroduced, it retains the idea that stipulations that fix the meanings of my words\nmust be temporally prior to my use of those words: first someone stipulates, and that\ngives later uses of the words meaning. in my view, the key to understanding\nrevisionary analyses is that they involve a stipulation that (partially) fixes the\nmeaning of prior uses of the word: in this kind of case, first we go about using a\nword, then later we make the stipulation that gives meaning.7\non this view, in typical cases of revisionary analysis there is no change of meaning\nand no change of subject. words are used univocally throughout a discourse; each\nword expresses the same concept throughout, even when one party proposes a\nrevisionary analysis. what happens when a proposed revisionary analysis is successful\nis that stipulations that fix the meaning of a word (throughout the discourse) have\nemerged late in the discourse.\nthe subject continuity view may seem like a radical departure from familiar\nconceptions of stipulation and analyticity—perhaps it constitutes a somewhat revisionary\nanalysis of stipulation and of analyticity—but it is inevitable given the\nconclusions that we have already reached. the argument argument gives us reason\nto reject the subject-change view: we should maintain that words are univocal—that\nno meaning-change occurs and no new concepts are introduced—before and after\nrevisionary analysis. but we have also granted that successful revisionary analyses are\nin fact (metasemantic) analyses; they partially fix the meanings of words. since they\n7 the general term for views on which the meaning of an expression or the content of a thought can\ndepend on facts about later times is temporal externalism. for discussion and defence, see jackman (1999,\n2005); ball (forthcoming).\n    \n                                              \n    \n    \n  '], [52, '52\ndo not introduce new meanings or new words, they must fix the meanings that words\nhave had all along. and this is just the core claim of the subject continuity view.\n5. successful analysis\nbut the subject continuity view may seem to leave us with a serious problem. on\ntraditional views of stipulation, such as the subject-change view—views on which\nstipulation precedes use—in typical cases there will be no serious problem in\ndetermining whether a given stipulation was successful: if we make a stipulation,\nand then go on to use the word stipulatively introduced, the stipulation was successful.\n8 but on the subject continuity view, the picture is more complex. we may have\nmultiple parties to a dispute, each proposing a competing revisionary analysis, all of\nwhich purport to fix the meaning of the same set of uses of a term. what makes it the\ncase that one of these proposed analyses fixes the meaning, while the others do not \nin order to answer this question, i want to begin by considering a metasemantic\nstory that some philosophers have taken to support the subject-change view that we\nhave just rejected: the view that meaning is use. as this slogan is typically interpreted\nin this debate, the view that meaning is use amounts to the view that the extension of\na term as used by a speaker is determined by that speaker’s dispositions to apply the\nterm and to withhold application of the term. call this meaning is use now (miun). \nmiun suggests that revisionary analysts are changing the subject, since (at least to\nthe extent their dispositions to apply the term are consistent with their proposed\nanalysis) revisionary analysts will exhibit quite a different pattern of applying and\nwithholding the term at issue; for example, the proponent of same-sex marriage will\napply the term ‘marriage’ to same-sex unions while her opponent will not, and\nhaslanger will withhold ‘woman’ from females who are not subordinated (if such\nthere be).\nthe problem with miun is similar to the problem with the subject-change view: it\ncannot make sense of our argumentative practice. we have already seen that the\nsubject-change view has trouble making sense of the full range of first-order argument,\nand to the extent that miun is committed to the subject-change view, it will\nshare this problem. i now want to emphasize an additional problem with the view\nthat meaning is use now: it cannot make sense of how we respond to arguments. in\nparticular, it cannot make sense of apparently rational and correct change of view.\nwe may be convinced by a revisionary analysis. suppose that i once believed that\nsame-sex marriage was impossible (and said things like, “a man can only marry a\nwoman and vice-versa”), but i was convinced by some argument that same-sex\nmarriage is possible after all. to keep the case simple, suppose that this last belief\nis stable (and so not overturned by further argument), and that most or all of my\nfellow speakers come to share my view.\n8 perhaps we need to make some further allowances to prevent the stipulative introduction of ‘tonk’ and\nthe like, but these complexities are not relevant to our present concerns.\n  see sundell (2012) for a defence of this kind of view from a proponent of the idea that revisionary\nanalysis requires meaning change.\n    \n           \n    \n    \n  '], [53, '53\nhow would i describe my change of view  one thing that i would take to have\nchanged is my metalinguistic beliefs; i used to take “same-sex couples can marry” to\nexpress a falsehood, but i came to believe that it expresses a truth. but this is neither\nthe only nor the most central belief that i would take to have changed; i would also\ntake myself to have believed that a man can only marry a woman, and to have come\nto reject this belief and to believe instead that same-sex couples can marry. (i might\nsay things like, “i used to think that two women could not marry each other, but now\ni see that i was wrong.”) that is, i would take my first-order views about marriage to\nhave changed.\nin section 1.1, i suggested that as a matter of methodology, we should look for an\ninterpretation of our debates about revisionary analysis that makes sense of what\nparticipants in the debate are doing. the same is true here: we should look for an\naccount of the debates that makes sense of our informed judgments about them. of\ncourse, we are not infallible about what we believed and meant. but other things\nequal—in cases when we are not obviously confused, irrational, suffering from\nmemory failure, and so on—an interpretation that makes sense of our judgments is\nto be preferred to an interpretation that does not. and since all that is at issue here is\nremembering my past views, and judging whether my current view is inconsistent\nwith them, the most obvious way an interpretation can make sense of my judgment is\nby making it correct. (perhaps this is the only way to make sense of it: since nothing is\nwrong with my memory, it seems hard to explain how i could fall into error.)\nthis is something that miun cannot deliver. according to miun, my dispositions\nto apply ‘marriage’ before i heard of the revisionary analysis make it the case\nthat ‘marriage’ as i used it picked out a relation that men can stand in only to women\nand vice-versa, while my dispositions after i accept the revisionary analysis make it\nthe case that ‘marriage’ as i use it picks out a relation that men can stand in to other\nmen. so miun cannot make me right when i say, ‘i used to think that two women\ncould not marry each other, but now i see that i was wrong’. as i use ‘marriage’ at the\ntime of this utterance, it isn’t true that i used to think that two women could not\n‘marry’ each other, and what i used to think wasn’t wrong. so in order to make me\ncorrect, what is wanted is a view that predicts not that the meaning of ‘marriage’ has\nchanged, but that what i meant all along is the relation that same-sex couples can\nstand in. in this case, the revisionary analysis has succeeded: claims like “two men\ncan marry each other” are metasemantically analytic of ‘marry’ as i used it all along.\nof course, there are cases in which miun delivers more plausible results. but even\nin these cases, it gets the right answer for the wrong reason. suppose i accept that being\na woman is a matter of biological fact, and say things like “necessarily, a person is a\nwoman iff she has two x chromosomes”—until a philosopher puts forward (w) as an\nanalysis of ‘woman’. i consider the analysis, and despite some intriguing arguments,\ni decide that the balance of considerations pull against accepting it. so i judge that (w)\nis false, and that “necessarily, a person is a woman iff she has two x chromosomes” is\ntrue. to keep the case simple, suppose that my rejection of (w) and my continued\nacceptance of the biological view are stable (and so not overturned by further argument),\nand that most or all of my fellow speakers share my views (so also reject (w)\nand accept the biological account of sex). and suppose further that in the end even the\nproponent of (w) changes her mind and becomes convinced that (w) is false.\n    \n                                              \n    \n    \n  '], [54, '54\nagain, on the assumption that i am being reasonable—not unduly stubborn, not\nneglecting relevant evidence, etc.—then my judgment is something we should aim to\nmake sense of, and the obvious way to do this is by making it correct. so we want a\nview that predicts that in this case, ‘woman’ as i use it picks out a biological concept\nthat makes no reference to social status. (w) purports to be an analysis of ‘woman’,\nbut in the end fails to do metasemantic work.\nmiun delivers this result; but we have already seen that it fails elsewhere, so that\nwe need to look for a different view. one suggestion would be to appeal to a wider\nrange of dispositions: not only dispositions to apply the term, but also dispositions to\nrespond to new information and so on. for example, perhaps the difference between\nthe described ‘marriage’ case and the described ‘woman’ case turns on my dispositions\nto respond to revisionary analyses. this strategy may make sense in some cases.\nbut in general, our dispositions are messy. i may be disposed to respond favourably\nto some arguments (in some moods, when presented by some interlocutors, in some\ntones of voice) but not others. i am not simply disposed to come to believe that samesex\nmarriage is possible no matter what: whether i come to believe this will depend\non exactly which arguments i encounter, and in which circumstances. my dispositions\njust don’t fix my meaning—or at least, not until they are activated in particular\ncircumstances. (that is why accepting a view can count as a stipulation, even though\nit is also a response to an argument.)\nthe obvious difference between the success of the revisionary analysis of ‘marriage’,\nand the failure of the revisionary analysis of ‘woman’ (in the described cases) is\nthat the successful analysis is accepted and the failed analysis is rejected. i suggest that\nthis obvious difference is what does the metasemantic work. at least in kind of\nsimplified case we are considering here (in which the debate is resolved), what makes\na given putative metasemantic analysis successful is that it is accepted.\nfurther, i suggest that once we have given up the subject-change view (and so\naccepted that there a single meaning/concept throughout the discourse), this is an\nextremely natural conclusion. we seem to have two possible accounts of what is\ngoing on in simple cases like the ones we are discussing:\nbeginning of debate the facts that fix meaning—including the stipulations and\nbeliefs that are metasemantic analyticities—must be in place at the beginning of a\ndiscourse. they fix the meanings of our terms and the content of our concepts\nthroughout the rest of the inquiry. so revisionary analyses always fail; if, at the\nbeginning of inquiry, we accept “marriage is the union of one man and one\nwoman”, then we cannot successfully advocate same-sex “marriage” without\nchanging the subject.\nend of debate the facts that fix meaning can be determined by the discourse. so\nrevisionary analyses can succeed; if everyone comes to accept on reasonable\ngrounds that same-sex marriage is possible, this goes toward making it the case\nthat ‘marriage’ picks out a relation that can hold between two men or two women.\nbut surely the end of debate picture is much to be preferred. it seems absurdly\nuncharitable—perverse, really—to maintain that if everyone goes from rejecting the\npossibility of same-sex marriage to accepting it (and regarding their prior first-order\n    \n           \n    \n    \n  '], [55, '55\nviews as incorrect), they are making a mistake, even if this transition is grounded in\napparently reasonable argument. it looks like we have a choice of preferring our\nviews prior to inquiry or our views after inquiry: but surely (other things equal) our\nviews after inquiry are to be preferred. (after all, it is only then that we have had a\nchance to consider the evidence.)\nof course, this is not to say that discussion can never go awry, or that we can never\nbe mistaken or confused. it is only to say that the views of people in a better epistemic\nposition are ceteris paribus to be preferred to the views of those in a worse epistemic\nposition.\n5.1. agreeing that a dispute is verbal, and other complications\nwe have made simplifying assumptions about the cases we have discussed: that\neveryone comes to agree, so that the debate is settled once and for all. and of course\nin many cases this kind of assumption will be entirely unrealistic. what predictions\ndo we make about more realistic cases  one kind complication of we can easily make\nsense of. some debates end not in agreement, but in acknowledgement that the\ndisputants were talking past each other, so that the debate was merely verbal. we\nalready mentioned that opponents of same-sex marriage sometimes claim that\nproponents are trying to redefine ‘marriage’. typically (and reasonably, on the\nview we are developing) proponents resist this charge. but proponents might also\n(and again, reasonably) agree that they are using ‘marriage’ differently, and proceed\nto dispute about how the word should be used. in this case, too, i think that the\nconsidered judgments of the parties to the conversation should be taken seriously: if\neveryone comes to the conclusion that the subject has changed, that can make it the\ncase that the subject has in fact changed.\nthe case where the (first-order) debate is resolved (or perhaps dissolved) when we\nagree that we are talking past each other reveals a final data point worth attending to.\nin this case, we may re-evaluate our earlier reactions to arguments and judge some of\nthem to have been confused. to revisit our example from section 1.1, if p has decided\nthat the dispute about same-sex “marriage” is merely verbal, then p should also\ndecide that o’s assertion of (1) did not put any pressure on her view. instead of\narguing against it, she should have rejected it as irrelevant.\nas before, an interpretation of the debate should seek to vindicate this considered\njudgment. and that is exactly the result we get when we take our end-of-debate\nclaims to be metasemantically analytic. when we are evaluating (1), for example,\nthere are three possibilities to consider:\n1. if o convinces p—so that o and p end up agreeing that same-sex marriage is by\ndefinition impossible—then the assertion of (1) will seem to have been a good\nargument: an argument that bears on the issue, and expresses a reasonable\nbelief. we vindicate this appearance: the assertion of (1) bears on the issue\nbecause it is inconsistent with the view that p held, and was a reasonable\ncommitment for someone with o’s view. (if p and o end up agreeing on (1),\nit too may end up as a metasemantic analyticity, hence true.)\n2. if p convinces o—so that o and p end up agreeing that same-sex marriage is\npossible—then the argument will seem flawed. if the assertion were true, it\n    \n                                              \n    \n    \n  '], [56, '56\nwould have been relevant (since it is incompatible with p’s position), and\nperhaps o had good reason to think it true; but a fuller consideration of the\nevidence revealed it to be false. we vindicate this appearance: since there is no\nmeaning change, the assertion will be relevant—it is inconsistent with p’s\nposition—but since p’s position is correct, the assertion will turn out to be false.\n3. if p and o agree that they are talking past each other, then the argument will\nseem irrelevant: either a truth that does not bear on p’s position, or a falsehood\n(and an obvious falsehood, given their current evidence). we vindicate this\nappearance: since in this scenario the word ‘marriage’ is used with two distinct\nmeanings in the conversation, there are two relevant interpretations of (1), one\nof which is an irrelevant truth and the other of which is a relevant falsehood.\nbut many typical disputes about revisionary analyses—at least in philosophy—do\nnot resolve at all: we do not agree, and we do not agree that our dispute is verbal\neither. and in this kind of case the considerations we have given so far make no\ndefinite prediction. the basic moral of our story is that facts about our future use can\nplay a meaning fixing role—can be metasemantically analytic—with respect to our\npresent use. exactly how meaning gets determined in any actual case will no doubt be\na complicated matter that requires weighing a variety of factors: facts about past,\npresent, and future dispositions and uses, as well as (probably) other sorts of facts\nabout the social and physical environment (which may include facts about metaphysical\nnaturalness and so on). the view we have developed does not answer every\nmetasemantic question. it only introduces a new factor to be considered—albeit a\nfactor that is decisive in many significant cases.\n6. conclusion\nthis chapter has defended the following claims:\n1. revisionary analysis does not typically involve change of meaning or the\nintroduction of new concepts.\n2. revisionary analyses can be seen as a kind of (attempted) stipulation, and so as\nattempts at giving metasemantic analyticities; but if they are successful, they fix\nthe meaning of words as we have always used them (even before the stipulation\ntook place).\nthese claims together constitute a view that repudiates the idea that philosophy is\npurely descriptive—in making judgments, we are also making our meanings and\nconcepts, not merely “leaving everything as it is”—but at the same time repudiates\nthe idea that we are changing the subject, or choosing between different concepts.\n(making judgments, forming beliefs, choosing theories  yes. conceptual engineering\nor conceptual ethics (understood as something other than this)  no.)\nlet me conclude by returning to jackson’s worry: does the stipulation that “a free\naction is one such that the agent would have done otherwise if he or she had chosen\nto” result in a change of subject that turns “interesting philosophical debates into easy\nexercises in deductions from stipulative definitions together with accepted facts” \njackson’s worry is not completely unfounded, since it is possible that this stipulation\n    \n           \n    \n    \n  '], [57, '57\nwould change the subject; it would change the subject if the parties to the debate treat\nit as changing the subject, for example by refusing to engage with first-order\nargument for and against it. but philosophers who make this kind of claim do not\nusually have this attitude. it is perfectly possible to introduce a particular account of\nfree action, recognizing it as a stipulation that will have a metasemantic effect if\naccepted, but still engaging in interesting philosophical debates. this is exactly what\nproponents of revisionary analyses usually do.\nso could women be analytically oppressed  yes: (w) could be metasemantically\nanalytic. are they analytically oppressed  that depends on whether proponents of\n(w) make a case that convinces us.\nacknowledgements\ni am grateful to audiences at the universities of st andrews and oslo, to the participants in\nemanuel viebahn’s seminar at humboldt university, to the faculty reading

\n\n59\n3\nminimal substantivity\ndelia belleri\n1. introduction\nontological debates may be characterized as disagreements about what there is.\nphilosophers debate on whether there are numbers, propositions, universals, species,\ngenders, and much more. two of these ontological disputes have sparked significant\ncontroversy in recent years. the first dispute revolves around questions of persistence,\nasking how an object can exist through time, undergoing changes while remaining\nthe same entity. an influential account, called perdurantism, has it that objects\npersist through time by having temporal parts (armstrong 1980; lewis 1986;\nheller 1990; sider 1997). endurantism, by contrast, rejects the existence of temporal\nparts, holding that objects are wholly present at each moment of their existence\n(haslanger 1989; van inwagen 1990; merricks 1994; wiggins 2001; fine 2006). the\nsecond debate is about composite material objects and it revolves around the question\nwhether these objects exist and, if they do, which ones exist. nihilists hold that\ncomposition never occurs, and that only simples exist (unger 1979; wheeler 1979;\ndorr 2005). universalists, by contrast, hold that it is sufficient for two objects to exist\nin order for them to compose something (lewis 1986; van cleve 1986; armstrong\n1997; rea 1998). finally, moderatists argue that composition obtains in some cases\nand not in others: for instance, only when the parts concur together to form a life, or\nwhen they are otherwise connected (van inwagen 1990; merricks 2001; markosian\n2014; carmichael 2015).\ni will refer to these debates as the persistence debate and the composition debate\nrespectively. also, although for reasons of space my examples in this chapter will\ndraw only on the persistence debate, i submit what i say could apply, modulo relevant\ndistinctions, to the composition debate too (i will briefly return to it in section 6).\nin metaontology, diverging views about the composition and persistence debates\nhave emerged. ontological deflationism holds that these disputes are not substantive.\nsome deflationists argue that these are merely terminological discussions, to be\nresolved by reaching an agreement about which linguistic expressions belong to\nplain english (hirsch 2005, 2009). others argue that these disputes involve questions\nthat are either easily answered within a language, or are otherwise unanswerable\nbecause asked outside of a language (thomasson 2009, 2015). other deflationists yet\nhold that the competing views are all somehow equivalent (sidelle 2002; miller 2005),\nwhere this might be taken to entail that we have too little evidence to choose one\n \n  '], [60, '60\nontological view rather than another (see especially bennett 2009). the opposite\napproach may be labelled ontological anti-deflationism, according to which these\nontological disputes are substantive. a pragmatist-naturalist anti-deflationism\nalong the lines dictated by quine (1948, 1951, 1960) will presumably say that the\ncomposition and persistence disputes are substantive insofar as one of the two\noptions should be recognized as more compatible with our best scientific description\nof the world. more radically, a hardcore realist along the lines of sider (2011) will say\nthat these disputes are substantive insofar as one of the competing options carves\nreality at its joints better than the other.\nit is not clear that either of these views satisfactorily accounts for the status of the\npersistence and composition debates. on the one hand, the deflationist dismissal\ndoes not do justice to the following facts: first, that opting for either of these theories\nimplies embracing certain commitments about what there is, thus assuming a position\nabout non-linguistic, worldly facts; second, that each party to the debate can cite\nevidence that is sufficient at least by their own lights. on the other hand, embracing a\nfull-blown anti-deflationism may not help either, and the endurantism-perdurantism\ndebate nicely illustrates this point. first, a naturalist option may not be viable, for it is\nnot clear that, for example, perdurantism better fits with our current science. indeed\nsider (2001: 80ff) and miller (2005: 110\x0113) precisely show that endurantism can be\nformulated in a way that is compatible with special relativity, and is therefore not\ninferior to perdurantism in this respect. second, a realist position would be supremely\ndifficult to establish too, since it remains unclear (at least to me) whether it can be\nsuccessfully argued that there is conclusive, convincing evidence as to which option is\nmore joint-carving. with respect to the existence of temporal parts, indeed sider admits\nthat he has “no good epistemology of metaphysics to offer” (sider 2001: xv).\nmy project in this chapter is that of articulating a position intermediate between\ndeflationism and anti-deflationism. specifically, i wish to show that a minimal\nanti-deflationism about these debates is defensible, whereby the composition and\npersistence disputes are minimally substantive. as i will try to outline it, minimal\nsubstantivity is incompatible with kinds of defectiveness like mere verbality and lack\nof sufficient evidence; however, at the same time it implies no naturalistic or realistic\ncommitments. as such, the notion of minimal substantivity could help restore the\nontological respectability of the composition and persistence debates, with no need\nto submit oneself to much more committal views about what it is for a dispute to be\nontologically substantive.\nbefore proceeding, i should say something concerning the relationship between\nthe notion of minimal substantivity that i am about to outline and the main theme of\nthe present volume—namely, what burgess and plunkett (2013) call conceptual ethics\nand what herman cappelen (2018) calls conceptual engineering. i believe the notion\nof minimal substantivity helps explain how and why some debates that are (either\novertly or covertly) about the engineering of some concept are ontologically relevant,\neven when these kinds of endeavours do not aim at identifying concepts that are\nnaturalistically adequate, or let alone joint-carving.¹\n¹ for a proposal alternative to mine, see díaz-león (chapter 9, this volume).\n \n  \n  '], [61, '61\nthe engineering of concepts like g, r, w, b, m may\nbelong precisely to this category. indeed, as barnes (2014: 337\x018) points out, the\nphilosopher may even assume from the start that these concepts track social constructions,\nwhere this by no means entails either (i) fundamental joint-carving; or (ii)\nreduction to facts described by the natural sciences.² if these enterprises are to be\naccepted as still ontologically substantive, the relevant notion of substantivity needs\nto be free from the above metaphysical preconceptions. this is where the notion of\nminimal substantivity can help: it can shed light on a way in which these tasks of\nconceptual engineering can be regarded as ontologically substantive, even when the\npurpose of the engineering itself is neither joint-carving nor naturalistic adequacy.\nlast, the present contribution may also itself be viewed as an exercise in the\nengineering of the concept m s. i realize this concept is far\nfrom belonging to our ordinary repertoire; consequently, i see myself as trying to\narticulate a novel notion rather than as trying to ameliorate a pre-existing one. my\nhope is that of offering a useful conceptual tool, which will help trace finer-grained\ndistinctions and sharpen our philosophical understanding of the status of some\ndisputes about what there is.\n2. the minimum requirement for substantivity\nas already mentioned in the introduction, i believe a minimal anti-deflationism is\navailable in logical space: ontological disputes are substantive in (at least) a “minimal”,\nyet interesting sense. my goal is to bring out, and elaborate on, this sense.\nfor purely operative purposes, we might begin our inquiry by considering what it\nis that we require, at a minimum, from a full-blown substantive dispute. this\nconsideration will guide us in the process of unearthing and delineating a notion of\nminimal substantivity.\nit seems to me the minimum necessary (and by no means sufficient) requirement\nfor a genuinely substantive dispute to obtain is that it is not verbal, that is, such that\nthe disputants are not simply talking past each other:\n[substantivity] if an ontological dispute is substantive, then it is non-verbal.\nwith this formulation in mind, let us ask: do ontological disputes meet this necessary,\nminimal criterion for substantivity there is a story, due to eli hirsch, according\nto which they do not. hirsch’s view has it that a verbal dispute is such iff each side\nought to agree that, on the most plausibly charitable interpretation, the other side\nspeaks the truth in its own favoured language (cf. hirsch 2005, 2008a,b, 2009).³\nlet us examine what hirsch would say with regard to an ontology dispute such as\nthat between endurantism and perdurantism. suppose that emma the endurantist\n² it could be pointed out that social constructions are the subject of social sciences, which count as\n“sciences” in the quinean methodology. even conceding this, it would still seem possible to deem these\nquestions as substantive in a lesser sense. the present proposal offers a way of bypassing such issues of\nranking.\n³ other influential accounts of verbal disputes are offered by chalmers (2011); jenkins (2014); and\nbalcerak-jackson (2014).\n \n  \n  '], [62, '62\nutters: “there is a tree in front of us”, while percy the perdurantist rebuts her claim:\n“no, there is a sequence of temporal parts of a tree”. in order for emma to regard\nwhat percy says as true, charity requires that she interprets him as speaking a\nperdurantist version of english (call it p-english), where “there is” ranges over a\ndomain of objects that includes temporal parts (this is very rough4 but details can be\nglossed over for present purposes). symmetrically, percy should interpret emma as\nspeaking an endurantist version of english (e-english) where “there is” ranges over\nordinary objects, but not over temporal parts. if this happens, each speaker is uttering\nsomething true in their language, but they are not contradicting each other: the\ndispute is merely verbal.\none could question that charity considerations should demand that each side\nregards the other as saying something true. after all, regarding the other side as\nsaying something reasonable (although, for all one knows, false) would seem enough\nin the way of honouring charity, and it would not require concluding that the\nadversary is speaking a different language.5 so, the proponent of the hirsch strategy\nowes an explanation as to why charity should so heavily insist on attributing to the\ninterlocutor true, rather than merely rational beliefs.\ni think the following argument could be invoked to this end: in general, charity\nenjoins us to attribute to our interlocutors the best doxastic state they could find\nthemselves in given the information available to us.6 unless there are defeating\nconsiderations, the best such doxastic state is one that involves a reasonable, true\nbelief. therefore, if the subject is in a position to regard an interlocutor’s belief as\nreasonable and true (and emma and percy are in such position), and instead regards\nit as merely reasonable, but for all one knows also false, one is not being fully\ncharitable. if this argument is sound, and unless ontological disputes are shown to\ngive rise to defeating considerations,7 then assuming emma and percy wish to be\nfully charitable, they should consider each other as speaking truly in a different\n4 there is a complication here: emma rejects the existence of temporal parts, so it would be incoherent\nfor her to believe that the quantifier ranges over temporal parts. addressing this point, hirsch (2009:\n249\x0151) seems to allow that emma fails to subscribe to a tarski semantics for p-english, even though she\nsubscribes to a tarski semantics for e-english. more accurately, emma can believe that in her own\nlanguage (e-english), truth depends on reference, but need not accept that this holds for every possible\nlanguage (including p-english). so emma can consistently believe that in e-english, the truth of “fa”\ndepends on the singular term referring to some object—which cannot be a temporal part, but need not\naccept that, in p-english, the truth of “fa” depends on the singular term referring to an object which could\nbe a temporal part. she can simply believe that the truth of “fa” in p-english depends on such-and-such\nbeing the case, where “such-and-such” is a description issued in e-english.\n5 balcerak-jackson suggests (2012: 17–18) that the endurantist could regard the opponent’s statement as\nfalse in ordinary english because based on a conceptual error, however excusably so, because the matter\nunder discussion is complex enough that the speaker might have committed a mistake along the way\nwithout losing her rationality (for a similar point, see horden 2014: 237–8).\n6 i take this formulation to be broad enough as to accommodate various ways of spelling out the\nprinciple of charity, as formulated by, among others, quine, grandy, davidson, and lewis, as well as\nhirsch himself.\n7 it could be argued that, if the cost of regarding the opponent as having a true and reasonable belief is\npositing a linguistic difference, this cost constitutes a defeating consideration. but it is not obvious to me\nthat the cost in the case of emma and percy is so high as to defeat the requirement for full charity. the issue\nis at best debatable.\n \n  \n  '], [63, '63\nversion of english, where “there is” has a different sense. therefore, ontological\ndisputes seem doomed to be diagnosed as verbal.\nin light of these considerations, what could be done in order to save the nonverbality\nof ontological disputes the only way of securing a disagreement seems to\n“move one level up”, so to speak: that is to say, to regard the dispute as taking place at\nthe metalinguistic level, and thus regard the parties as advocating each a different\n“idiolect” as the idiolect that is best to use in that philosophical context. hirsch seems\nto hint at similar considerations. addressing sider’s idea that ontologists can speak\nontologese, hirsch writes:\nmy advice is that [the philosophers who purport to speak ontologese] should stick to the metalevel\nand engage in disputes about which sentences are true in the philosophically best language,\nrather than attempting to speak that best language. (2008b: 520, my italics)\nin order to secure a non-verbal conflict, moving the dispute at the metalinguistic level\nwould seem to be a viable option. indeed, this suggestion gains support from\nsome recent developments in the meta-philosophical literature. david plunkett and\ntimothy sundell (cf. sundell 2011; plunkett and sundell 2013; plunkett 2015) have\nrecently maintained that a great number of philosophical disputes which look merely\nterminological are instead covertly metalinguistic and concern “a distinctive normative\nquestion—how best to use a word relative to a context” (2013: 3). plunkett and\nsundell contend that this metalinguistic, normative question is not overtly expressed,\nbut it is pragmatically communicated, so that the metalinguistic character of the\nexchange may not be immediately recognizable. following plunkett and sundell’s\nlead, more than one author has proposed to interpret at least some philosophical\ndisputes as being covertly metalinguistic: megan wallace (ms) focuses on\nontological debates about ordinary material objects, while amie thomasson (2016)\nconsiders debates about composition, essence, identity, and persistence, but also\ndisputes about what art is, about free will and determinism, and about the existence\nof races. in light of what these authors propose, hirsch’s suggestion could be\nhonoured by envisaging the possibility that these disputes be explicitly formulated\nin metalinguistic terms, thus moving to what plunkett and sundell (2013: 6\x017) and\nplunkett (2015: 836) would call a “canonical dispute”, centred on a literally expressed\ndisagreement about a metalinguistic, normative question.\ngoing back to the exchange between emma the endurantist and percy the\nperdurantist, the friend of metalinguistic disputes could say that, although the two\ndisputants would seem engaged in a first-order communication about whether or not\nthere are temporal parts, what they are really doing is negotiating the sense of “there\nis”. this opens up the possibility of making the metalinguistic conflict explicit: in the\nnewly conceived dispute, emma would be overtly advocating an endurantist (commonsensical)\nsense of the term, which allows one to existentially quantify over trees,\ntables, and mountains but not over temporal parts; and percy would be overtly\nadvocating a perdurantist sense of “there is”, which permits existential quantification\nover all these objects plus their temporal parts.\nlet us therefore assume that it is possible to recast first-level ontological disputes as\nmetalinguistic debates. this move has a problematic consequence which needs to be\ndealt with: once the disagreement has moved at the metalinguistic level, it is not\n \n  \n  '], [64, '64\nontological any longer: it is about language, or at least about which semantics for a\ngiven language should be chosen. this seems to have little to do with ontological\nsubstantivity! what should we say, then, in order to preserve the idea that these are\nontologically interesting disputes—at least to a minimal degree\n3. rescuing the ontological significance\nof metalinguistic disputes\nin this section, i aim to show that, even if the only non-verbal disputes on matters of\npersistence (or composition) were metalinguistic ones, not all hopes are lost for those\nwho wish to rescue the “minimal substantivity” of these disputes. this is because the\nselection of certain linguistic options would seem to enjoin a certain degree of\nontological commitment once the choice is made. discussing the best linguistic\nresources for doing ontology may therefore have downstream ontological implications,\nto the extent that it may lead us to subscribing to certain ontological\ncommitments.\n3.1. first-order issues and ontological commitments\nmaintaining the focus on persistence debates, in what follows i wish to show that\nsome central arguments that have been proposed by supporters of perdurantism can\nbe reformulated as metalinguistic proposals to introduce some piece of terminology,\nfor example “temporal part”, where this should sanction an ontological commitment\nto temporal parts. these newly reformulated arguments may be regarded as starting\nwith problems that arise at the first order, that is, where language is used to talk about\nthe existence of objects and their properties through time, and as advancing a\nmetalinguistic proposal so as to obviate to these first-order problems. the purpose\nof these reconstructions is demonstrative: my aim is to show that it is possible to look\nat specific arguments offered in the literature in the material mode, as it were, in a\nnew metalinguistic light. the reader who already got the gist of the strategy may\nsafely skip the examples.\nto start with, we may choose the problem of temporary intrinsics. the first-order\nproblematic statement that needs philosophical consideration may be rendered as\nfollows: “if a certain object o changes by being f at a certain moment t and\nsubsequently being not-f at t + 1, then o has incompatible properties at different\ntimes; if this is so, then o at t is not identical with o at t + 1.” david lewis’ (1986)\nproposal, at the metalinguistic level, could be phrased as follows: let us introduce the\nnotion of “temporal part”. once we do this, our way of talking at the object-level\nchanges: it is no longer one and the same object o to which we ascribe the incompatible\nproperties of being f and being not-f; it is two numerically distinct temporal\nparts of o, call them temp-1 and temp-2.\nas a second example, we may consider the case of arbitrary undetached parts. at\nthe object level, the predicament to be dealt with may be thus expressed: “if descartes\nis deprived of a leg at t, he then becomes (say) descartes-minus. now, it seems that\ndescartes-minus before t is the same as descartes-minus after t; also, descartes after t\nis the same as descartes-minus after t; and also, that descartes is the same before and\n \n  \n  '], [65, '65\nafter t; it would then follow that descartes-minus before t is the same as descartes\nbefore t. but this is not the case.” the solution proposed by heller (1990) could be\nstated as follows at the metalinguistic level. if we introduce the term “temporal part”,\nthen at the object-language level there is no tension between the following statements:\n“the temporal part of descartes-minus after t and the temporal part of\ndescartes after t are the same”; and “the temporal part of descartes-minus before\nt and the temporal part of descartes before t are not the same”.\nas a last example, let us pick the argument from vagueness in defence of perdurantism.\nhere is the problematic inference that needs philosophical attention. if\nobjects gradually go out of existence, it is vague whether they form diachronic\nunits—that is, units that start and cease to exist. this is unacceptable, for it would\nentail that existence is vague, while existence as expressed through the logical\nvocabulary is not vague. sider (1997, 2001) offers a response which, at the metalinguistic\nlevel, could look like this: if we introduce the notion “temporal part” and if we\nsubscribe to unrestricted composition, we avoid vague existence, and consequently\nalso indeterminate statements at the object-language level. for now whatever diachronic\nsum of temporal parts we consider is a genuine composite object with clearcut\ntemporal boundaries.\nit is important to note that, at least for the advocates of perdurantism, acceptance\nof the term introduced seems to imply an ontological commitment to temporal parts,8\nat least in the sense of supposing that temporal parts are in the domain of one’s\nexistential quantifier (quine 1948: 32; 1960: 242). for it would be odd to just talk in\nterms of temporal parts, while at the same time denying that there are temporal parts.\nthe best way for avoiding ontological commitment to temporal parts would be to\nexpunge the term “temporal part” from one’s terminology (e.g., by paraphrasing it\naway); but since the proponents of perdurantism do exactly the opposite, it seems\nsafe to say that term introduction also marks (and should mark) an ontological\ncommitment to temporal parts.\nto be sure, the perdurantist could introduce talk of temporal parts as a useful\nfiction, where this would indeed imply just speaking in terms of temporal parts while\ndenying that there are any temporal parts. although this option is available, this is\nimportantly not what authors who identify as perdurantists either do or should do, if\nanything because the ensuing position could not ultimately count as a form of bona\nfide perdurantism, but would rather count as a form of nominalism about temporal\nparts. otherwise put, if perdurantists wish to hold a position that they could\nlegitimately describe as realism (of some form), a fictionalist move would simply be\na non-starter.\n8 it is perhaps not fully accurate to say that the whole question at stake in a metalinguistic ontological\ndispute on “temporal part” is just whether or not we should introduce the term “temporal part”. for if this\nwere the case, then it seems that by merely conceding that one could introduce the term “temporal part”,\nthe endurantist would be committed to temporal parts. to avoid this result, the question at stake should be\nmade more precise, for instance: “should one introduce the term «temporal part», where this implies that\none wishes to quantify over certain entities, thereby ontologically committing to them” (thanks to\nrichard woodward for stressing this point.)\n there are also motivation issues. notice the contrast between a version of perdurantism that expects to\nbe fictionalist from the outset and standard fictionalist proposals in other domains. standard\n \n  \n  '], [66, '66\nthere is an additional element regarding the commitments following from a\ncertain linguistic proposal. when two metalinguistic proposals enter into conflict,\nit seems reasonable to expect that the proposal which eventually prevails in the\ndispute (if any) will imply some ontological commitments for all the disputants. thus\nfor instance, were the perdurantist to “win” the dispute, this would imply a commitment\nfor all parties to use “there is” in such a way as to quantify over temporal parts.\nthis would have various implications about which statements are evaluated as true or\nfalse among the parties: for instance, a statement of “yesterday’s temporal part of this\ntree is not the same as today’s temporal part” would now be considered as true. by\ncontrast, were the endurantist to “win” the dispute, it seems that the existential\nquantifier would have to be used by all parties in such a way as to not quantify\nover temporal parts, and statements like “this tree is the same as yesterday’s tree”\nwould consequently be deemed true.\nit therefore seems that the ontological import of the metalinguistic dispute comes\nfrom the joint contribution of two factors. the first is that introducing certain\nlinguistic expressions (like “temporal part”) would seem to imply an ontological\ncommitment to certain objects for the proponents of the linguistic introduction. the\nsecond is that a resolution of the dispute in favour of one option or another would\nseem capable to affect the ontological commitments of all the parties to the dispute.\nif these considerations are sound, we now seem to have a first-pass proposal\nregarding a sufficient condition for the obtaining of minimal substantivity in ontological\ndisputes:\n[minimal substantivity-1] an ontological dispute is minimally substantive if it is\nlinked with a metalinguistic, non-verbal dispute whose resolution can affect the\nparties’ ontological commitments.\nit should be stressed that being ontologically committed to, say, temporal parts need\nnot mean believing, for instance, that “temporal part” refers to temporal parts in any\nrobust sense, or that temporal parts are objects in any inflated, heavyweight sense. there\nare ways of conceiving reference and objecthood that are sufficiently deflationary so as\nto guarantee that ontological commitment stays suitably deflationary too.\nfor instance, one may have a sufficiently broad notion of reference which not only\nimplies that it is a language-world relation, but also that it could obtain when certain\nintra-language relations obtain. according to this less demanding notion, reference\nneed not obtain only when an object is picked out by a certain term t, but it could also\nobtain when the sentence s containing a certain term t is considered equivalent to\nhermeneutical fictionalism, for example, concerns linguistic practices that are already in place, from talk\nabout numbers (yablo 2002: 87) to talk about ordinary objects (rosen and dorr 2002: 171). an important\nmotivation for the view seems to be that since we cannot get rid of these already established practices, we\nneed a way of salvaging as much as possible of a set of linguistic usages that are otherwise regarded as\nmetaphysically and semantically confused. the practice proposed by a fictionalist perdurantist would,\nhowever, be a new one. the purpose of legitimizing a defective practice that we cannot get rid of would be\nutterly absent. this seems to deprive the fictionalist perdurantist of an important motivation that is\ncommonly associated with standard forms of fictionalism. one could then wonder what the motivation\nfor going fictionalist from the outset could be: why not be a conventionalist, or a deflationist realist, about\ntemporal parts (thanks to alexis burgess and david plunkett for prompting me to clarify these issues).\n \n  \n  '], [67, '67\nanother sentence s* that does not contain t and that is deemed true. following this\nstrategy, the perdurantist might say that, if the sentence: “an object o is f at time t1”\nis true, the sentence: “the t1-temporal part of o is f” is true too and hence, the term\n“temporal part” refers. the latter proposal would amount to a deflationary approach\nto the reference of terms like “temporal part” along neo-fregean lines (cf. hale and\nwright 2001, 2009).¹°\nanalogously, one need not believe that temporal parts are objects in any robust\nsense—for example, instantaneous or even just very short-lived spatio-temporal\nobjects.¹¹ indeed, the perdurantist may presume right from the start that temporal\nparts are to be considered objects in a more deflationary sense. for instance, she\ncould say that a temporal part is an object in the “covering” sense of the term\nindividuated by thomasson (2007, 2009, 2015), in that from the sentence “today’s\ntemporal part of this tree is blossoming” it is possible to infer “something is\nblossoming” where “something” plays the role of a dummy sortal.\nof course, whether or not the perdurantist will be happy with this minimal set-up\nwill depend on her stance with relation to what reference and objecthood amount to.\nhowever, it seems entirely possible and not ad hoc to opt for a combination of\nontological commitment plus deflationary reference and objecthood, and still be\nconsidered as somebody who engages in a dispute that has some ontological significance.\notherwise put: it seems possible, and not ad hoc or let alone inconsistent, for\nsomeone to accept: (i) that the dispute about temporal parts has a minimal ontological\nsignificance insofar as it concerns the selection of a language from which\ncertain ontological commitments are to be extracted; and (ii) that reference to\ntemporal parts themselves, or that the kind of objects they are, are construed in a\ndeflationary fashion.\nso far, i have argued in what sense metalinguistic proposals—such as that of\nintroducing the term “temporal part”—may have an ontological significance, for\nthey might create an ontological commitment as a result of the dispute. the ontological\ncommitment can be formulated in a sense that is (i) minimal enough as to\nexclude robust views of reference and objecthood; but still (ii) sufficient for ensuring\nthat the proposal has some ontological import.\n3.2. resisting two attempts at downplaying the proposal\none way in which this proposal may be downplayed is by arguing as follows: the\nmetalinguistic negotiations considered so far are disagreements that only obtain\nbetween philosophers. some of the competing linguistic options could at best\nimply ontological commitments for a few, initiated ontologists (e.g., the commitment\n¹° it is also possible to follow other deflationary accounts of reference: horwich’s (1998) view would\nhave it that the term refers so long as the meaning of “temporal part” is constituted by certain use-features,\nand the expression occurs in instances of a disquotational schema like: “(x) (<n> refers to x iff x = n)”. field\n(1994: 261–3), would presumably emphasize the term’s computational role; brandom (1994: 360–70)\nwould stress the expression’s inferential role and the substitution patters in which it enters; while burgess\n(2015) suggests that, in an inferentialist framework, a term refers if it occurs in a simple atomic truth.\n¹¹ one could have qualms with instantaneous objects (as noted by fine 2006: 700), or with short-lived\ntemporal parts (like my temporal part between october 1, 2016, and october 2, 2016), on account that\nphysical objects like these could not “pop in and out of existence”.\n \n  \n  '], [68, '68\nto temporal parts). given what eli hirsch calls “the lack of authority that philosophers\nhave in our culture” (hirsch 2008a: 181), it seems that some of the competing\noptions could not make it out of the “ontology room” and be absorbed into\nordinary usage. this seems to significantly reduce the interest of minimal substantivity,\nbecause even if the dispute produced a change in ontological commitments,\nthese may well remain confined within the narrow conversational setting of a few\nacademic specialists. in response to this downplaying attempt, let me try to more\nprecisely pin down the connection between the philosophers’ (metalinguistic) dispute\nand the broader ontological “language games” practised in ordinary language.\nto start with, it seems uncontentious that, when we think and talk about what\nthere is—in both ordinary life and in philosophy—we engage in “language games”¹²\nwhich feature certain types of expressions and certain rules about how to use those\nexpressions. these linguistic resources mainly consist of the quantificational apparatus,\nthe numerals, the identity sign, plus nouns, predicates, and variables. there is\ntherefore an undeniable continuity between the linguistic resources employed by the\nontologist and the linguistic resources employed in order to talk about what there is\nin ordinary contexts.\nnow, the language game of talking about the existence of temporal parts is one that\nalmost exclusively philosophers engage in; however, nothing prevents that, at least in\nprinciple, the linguistic usages established by the philosophical discussion “leak” into\n(some fragments of ) the ordinary language, thus affecting the ontological commitments\nand interpretations of the relevant key vocabulary. note that this does not\nrequire us to imagine a world where philosophers have authority over ordinary\nlinguistic usages; it only requires to imagine a world where the uses in the ontology\nroom causally contribute to a change (or consolidation, where applicable) of ordinary\nlanguage games about what there is. this seems like a much less demanding scenario\nthan the one hirsch seems to expect to obtain. as to the contention that the notion of\nminimal substantivity is not interesting enough because the link with ordinary\nlinguistic practices is too feeble, i will not pursue the issue further, partly because it\nis not clear what “interesting” in this context might exactly mean, partly because\nit seems to me obvious that there is at least one sense in which this notion is\ninteresting enough, given appropriate aims and purposes.\nthere is another way in which [minimal substantivity-1] might be downplayed,\nthis time linked to a specifically (neo)-carnapian way of portraying the role of\nlanguage in ontology. the potential worry could be illustrated with an example\ndrawn from amie thomasson’s work. thomasson finds it objectionable that there\nmay be more than one sense of the existential quantifier—a joint-carving sense in\naddition to its standard, first-order predicate logic sense (conferred by introduction\nand elimination rules). if the existential quantifier only has one sense, then any\nsentence purportedly formulated with the other sense of the quantifier would be\nsemantically defective, either because it has no clear meaning or because it is\nstraightforwardly false (thomasson 2015: 317; 2016: 8\x019). so, even if the dispute\n¹² the expression “language games” is simply meant to designate rule-governed practices of language\nuse; it should not be understood as a way of endorsing wittgensteinian ideas on meaning or rule-following.\n \n  \n  '], [69, '69\neventually led (or seemed to have led) to a change in ontological commitments, the\nonly parties uttering semantically acceptable sentences at the first-level would be the\nparties that stick to the standard semantics of the quantifier. the parties deviating\nfrom such standard semantics would be committing a form of semantic mistake. in\nthis case, any such dispute would be a disappointment: for only one party could ever\nbe right, because only one party would be upholding the semantics of english.\nif the focus is restricted to the semantics of the existential quantifier, thomasson\nmay have her reasons to look unfavourably at the notion of minimal substantivity,\nwhich i will not discuss here. however, she need not reject that metalinguistic\nnegotiation might concern other kinds of expressions, for example nouns like\n“table”, “number”, “person”, “corporation”, or “marriage”. in particular, she may\nwell accept that metalinguistic negotiation is sometimes needed in order to clarify or\nprecisely determine the conditions of application of a certain term, or to change them\nso as to overcome a number of semantic flaws. in thomasson’s own words:\nconceptual work needn’t be simply explicative: . . . at times we may have work to do to\ndetermine how best to fill in the details of our concept of ‘same person’ or ‘same work of\nart’, consistent with some (ethical, aesthetic, or pragmatic) purpose. conceptual work is also\ninvolved in determining whether tacit contradictions or incoherencies beset parts of our\nconceptual scheme. . . . ontologists may also be engaged in what carnap would have called\n‘conceptual engineering’: revising or devising systems of categories to help them better serve\nsome practical purpose. (thomasson 2015: 327\x018)\nit is compatible with this picture that, sometimes, a disagreement may arise concerning\nthe rules of application of a certain term; or concerning whether or not a new\nterm (with application rules to be fully worked out) should be introduced in the\nlinguistic framework used to talk about matters ontological. if ontological commitments\nwould flow from the adoption of these terms—for instance via analytic\nentailments, in accordance with her own account (thomasson 2007: 167; 2015:\n145\x0158)—then it seems that if the dispute could lead to a change or establishment\nof ontological commitments, the dispute would be minimally substantive after all,\neven in thomasson’s framework. therefore, setting aside her reservations on the\nsemantics of the existential quantifier, minimal substantivity turns out to be compatible\nwith the set-up proposed by thomasson, at least for some expressions.\nto be sure, thomasson may still not accept that the ontological commitments\nextracted from a certain framework be understood in terms of “robust” notions of\nexistence, reference, and object; they would rather have to be understood along\ndeflationary lines. still, it seems that [minimal-substantivity-1] is sufficiently schematic\nand independent of considerations of ontological robustness in order for it to\nbe effortlessly imported into her neo-carnapian account. as it turns out, then,\nthomasson’s views need not be hostile to the notion of minimal ontological\nsubstantivity.\nin general, the schematic character of [minimal-substantivity-1] makes it compatible\nwith several ways in which ontological commitment could be cashed out,\nranging from “robust” to “deflationary”. we could therefore say that [minimal-\nsubstantivity-1] is compatible with various ways of being a realist, ranging from\nhard-line approaches whereby certain objects or facts are taken as ontologically\n \n  \n  '], [70, '70\n“thick” and wholly language- or mind-independent, to minimal approaches where\ntheir existence is “thin” and often tied to semantic considerations. such approaches\ncan be held not only with regard to material objects, temporal parts or mathematical\nentities, but also with regard to—for example—moral properties and facts, and in\ngeneral in normative domains where realism can assume the nuances just outlined.\nmeta-ethics provides an example here, for one can either be a robust realist about\nmoral properties and facts; or one can be a “minimal realist” who confines herself to\nclaiming that moral discourse is truth-apt and by-and-large true, where this gives rise\nto no inflationary views about the nature of moral properties or facts. as gideon\nrosen puts it, “the minimal realist holds that in a thin and metaphysically unambitious\nsense, the doctrine correctly represents . . . a genuine domain of fact: at least\nsome of the objects the discourse posits really exist, and the corresponding singular\nterms refer . . . ” (rosen 1994: 281). if what i have argued is right, [minimal substantivity-\n1] serves the minimal and non-minimal moral realist equally well.\nto conclude this section, i have argued that metalinguistic disputes related to\ncertain ontological matters (like persistence or composition) can be considered as\n“minimally substantive”. the metalinguistic proposals in play (as, for example, that\nof introducing talk about temporal parts) imply a certain degree, no matter how\nminimal or deflationary, of ontological commitment, so minimal substantivity has to\ndo with the potential the dispute has to affect the parties’ ontological commitments.\ntwo attempts at downplaying minimal substantivity have also been deflected, by (i)\npointing out that the dispute could in principle affect the ontological commitments\nunderlying ordinary language games and (ii) showing that the notion of minimal\nsubstantivity is compatible with metalinguistic negotiation within a (neo)-carnapian\nset-up.\n4. rescuing the epistemic significance\nof metalinguistic disputes\nthe deflationist could concede that the metalinguistic disputes associated with the\npersistence and composition debates comply with [minimal substantivity-1]. yet,\nshe could insist, the disagreement suffers from another kind of defectiveness, one\nwhereby we do not have enough evidence to choose between one linguistic option\nand the other—for example, between e-english and p-english. this position is\ndubbed by karen bennett (2009: 73) epistemicism.\ni will now reconstruct a potential epistemicist argument that may apply to the\nmetalinguistic negotiation between p-english and e-english (bennett’s version concerns\nthe very theories, like endurantism and perdurantism). the epistemicist about\nthe metalinguistic dispute between e-english and p-english could say, first of all, that\nneither of the two languages seems to guarantee greater simplicity. the perdurantist\nwill obviously have to increase the complexity in her language by adopting the term\n“temporal part”. however, the endurantist will also complicate her language by\nturning monadic predicates like “being blue” into polyadic predicates like “being\nblue-tly”. therefore, it is not clear who wins on the front of simplicity. second, it is\nnot clear that the perdurantist’s linguistic innovations help completely and uniformly\n \n  \n  '], [71, '71\nto solve endurantism’s problems. recall that the endurantist struggles with\nco-location, in that her account leaves it open whether, in the lump-statue case,\nthere are two objects or just one. the standard worm-theory perdurantist claims to\nsolve the problem by saying that the temporally extended lump and the temporally\nextended statue share some temporal parts, exactly like two roads can share a stretch\nof road (sider 2001: 153). however, we could imagine that the statue and the lump\nare created and destroyed at the same times (gibbard 1975: 191), where this revives\nthe puzzle for the perdurantist as well: are there two temporally extended objects or\njust one (cf. magidor 2016: 524) provided this line of argument could go through,\nabsence of sufficient grounds to select one option as opposed to the other would\nundermine the significance of the dispute.\nin arguing against this epistemic criticism, i will assume that there are two angles\nfrom which to look at a dispute: one is the “external” angle, to be identified with the\nbird-eye perspective of the neutral onlooker. this is the perspective of someone\nwho accepts that, in adjudicating between different languages (like e-english or\np-english) that are associated with ontological theories (endurantism and perdurantism),\nwe should keep in mind that a number of “theoretical virtues” ought to be\nhonoured—like simplicity or explanatory power. however, one has no determinate\nviews as to which virtues should take priority, thus remaining somewhat “neutral” or\n“open-minded”. the other perspective is the “internal” one, to be identified with the\npoint of view of an engaged participant to the dispute. this the perspective of\nsomeone who, for instance, has clear views about which theoretical virtues should\ntake priority when adjudicating between e-english as the language of endurantism\nand p-english as the language of perdurantism. for instance, one may believe that\nontological simplicity/parsimony should be maximized even if this meant increasing\nideological complexity.\nhaving distinguished between the “external” and “internal” perspective, one may\ngrant to the epistemicist that, from the “external” point of view, evidence does not\nfavour any of the linguistic options, because they all stand on a par with respect to a\nnumber of features. however, it seems to me plausible that from the “internal”\nperspective, there will often be some admissible consideration that appears conclusively\nto favour one particular choice.¹³ for instance, the endurantist may concede\nthat she has to make her predicates more complicated, but also consider that as a\nbearable cost at least if she is a nominalist about properties. the cost of complicating\nthe predicates may be outweighed by the benefits of not introducing terms that imply\ncommitments to new objects—like temporal parts. avoidance of a certain object-talk\nmay therefore count as a sufficient reason to adopt e-english, at least relative to these\ntheoretical considerations.\nalso, all participants to the dispute would seem to be entitled to the theoretical\nconsiderations they favour, provided these are admissible by the lights of the\n¹³ i am saying “often” and not “always” (or, let alone, “necessarily”), because cases should be allowed\nwhere these admissible considerations are lacking, and there is therefore no internal justification. absent\ninternal justification, the subject would therefore not be fully rational in believing her favoured theory.\npresumably, in this case the subject should suspend judgement, or believe with a very low credence.\n \n  \n  '], [72, '72\nphilosophical community’s standards, and are not merely idiosyncratic motivations.\nso, the perdurantist would seem to be entitled to her preference for the\nontologically committal idiom of temporal parts, if, for example, maintaining a\nmonadic conception of temporary intrinsic properties is more important for her;\nfor such a ranking of preferences would count as an admissible consideration.\nanalogously, the endurantist seems entitled to a more complicated ideology, if she\nis willing to trade that with a smaller, temporal-parts free ontology; for this too\nstrikes as an admissible consideration. if all parties are entitled to such preferences,\nthen if their views honour them, believing these views will be justified at least\nrelative to the adopted perspective. their views would therefore enjoy an “internal”\ntype of justification. (a further question, which i cannot settle here, is whether\n“internal” justification has any interesting relation with truth-conduciveness. in\nbelleri (2017) i argue that it does).\nso far, we have simply argued that the internal perspective is available besides\nthe external one. now we need to be convinced that the external perspective is\nnot relevant in the assessment of ontological disputes. the epistemicist seems to\nassume exactly this, so countering this thesis may constitute a strategy for\nundermining her case. i wish to suggest that recognizing the internal perspective\nallows a more charitable reconstruction of the epistemic status of the debate, and\nshould then be preferred to the external perspective. so for instance, countenancing\nthe internal perspective allows one to say that each party to the debate has\nsufficient justification (of the internal kind) to believe their view, while the\nexternal perspective would view them as insufficiently justified, tout court. furthermore,\naccording to the internal approach, the considerations each party\ninvokes in favour of their view offer epistemic support to it at least relative to\ntheir own perspective. by contrast, in the external approach, the reasons invoked\nby the parties could not count as conclusive even from each party’s own point of\nview. in virtue of the greater charity afforded by the internal approach, and\nassuming that ceteris paribus an account that maximizes charity is to be preferred,\ni then conclude we should deem the internal approach more relevant than\nthe external approach.\nthe upshot, then, is that even if metalinguistic ontological disputes were faced with\nthe threat of “external ungroundedness” posed by bennett’s epistemicism, as long as\neach of the linguistic options could be seen as internally, conclusively justified, these\nmetalinguistic disputes would not be completely epistemically deflatable, in that it\nwould not be possible to claim that we lack sufficient justification tout court to believe\nany side.\nin light of the foregoing considerations, we should qualify the sufficient condition\nspelled out in [minimal substantivity-1] by making it a conjunction of two conditions,\none about the dispute’s potential for language-change and the other about the\nnon-epistemic deflatability of the dispute.\n[minimal substantivity-2] an ontological dispute is minimally substantive if (a)\nit is linked with a metalinguistic, non-verbal dispute whose resolution can affect\nthe parties’ ontological commitments; and (b) the latter dispute is not epistemically\ndeflatable.\n \n  \n  '], [73, '73\n5. dispelling a threat of excessive proliferation\nit could be objected that [minimal substantivity-2] generates way too many minimally\nsubstantive ontological disputes. suppose carla argues that there are such things\nas “schmartinis”, which come into existence whenever an alcoholic drink is served in\na v-shaped glass, while farida rejects this existential claim. what should we say\nabout this case¹4\nsuppose for the sake of the argument that there are sufficient grounds for\nbelieving that carla and farida are having a metalinguistic dispute. at first sight,\nit may seem that the objector is right: in principle, this dispute could affect the\nparties’ ontological commitments, and carla could be internally justified, if she\nprovided admissible (not excessively idiosyncratic) considerations to which justification\ncould be relativized. the dispute would then be minimally substantive: a\nrather unpalatable consequence.\nthe problem with this objection is that it trades on an underdescribed scenario.\nwhat we learn from the schmartini case is that it seems wrong to call “minimally\nsubstantive” a dispute that, because of the very few details offered by the objector,\nseems to arise out of nowhere, seems not motivated by the need to solve a\nspecific problem, and where no immediately recognizable valuable consequence\nseems to result from the prevailing of any of the options at stake. however, it\nseems obvious that all these elements should normally be specified. so it seems\ndisingenuous to base the objection on an abnormally underdescribed case and\nnot on a normally, adequately described case, in which it would indeed be\npossible to appreciate why, for example, carla and farida are having the\nschmartini dispute in the first place, what problem they are trying to solve,\nand what benefits they pursue with their respective claims. if all these elements\nwere specified, i am confident that the verdict as to the dispute’s minimal\nsubstantivity would greatly differ.\nof course, it is open to the critic to find an example in which all the details are\nspecified and still it is counter-intuitive to call the exchange minimally substantive.\nmy expectation would be that (i) either the specified details make the dispute so silly\nand idiosyncratic that (at least) one of the two conditions contained in [minimal\nsubstantivity-2] is not met; or (ii) the specified details make the dispute reasonable\nenough as to turn out as minimally substantive.\nthe overgeneration charge contained in the schmartini objection therefore reveals\nwhat seems to be a background condition that has to be satisfied in order for the\nelements spelled out in [minimal substantivity-2] to suffice for minimal substantivity:\nthat the dispute occurs in a sufficiently rich context, where the rationale, aims,\nand prospective benefits of the dispute can be clearly identified. luckily for us, we can\nspecify all of these ingredients in the case of ontological disputes, as well as in\ncountless other philosophical and non-philosophical cases.\n¹4 thanks to esa díaz-león for discussion on this point.\n \n  \n  '], [74, '74\n6. conclusion: minimal anti-deflationism\nthe characterization encoded in [minimal substantivity-2] could be adopted to spell\nout a minimal form of anti-deflationism about some, if not all, ontological disputes.\nthe position is formulated in the following way:\n[minimal anti-deflationism] some (if not all) ontological disputes are minimally\nsubstantive, because even if the dispute at the first-level is verbal, it can be\nlinked to an explicitly metalinguistic dispute such that: (a) it could affect the\nparties’ ontological commitments; and (b) it is not epistemically deflatable.\nas i have shown, as long as there is sufficient evidence that the endurantism-\nperdurantism debate is a metalinguistic negotiation in the sense coined by plunkett\nand sundell (2013), we could move from an implicit, merely pragmatically conveyed\nnegotiation to an explicit disagreement, which plunkett and sundell would call a\n“canonical dispute”, about whether or not to employ certain linguistic items. if it is\ntrue (a) that this dispute could in principle affect our ontological commitments; and\n(b) that it is not epistemically deflatable, then the dispute is minimally substantive.\nas hinted at in the introduction, similar remarks apply, i submit, to the dispute\nbetween the views competing in the composition debate, involving such positions\nas nihilism, universalism, common-sense ontologies, organicism, and so on.\nalthough further work will have to be done in order to substantiate this claim, it is\nalready possible to offer a “preview” of how minimal anti-deflationism could be\napplied to the aforementioned dispute.\nto illustrate, consider a supporter of common-sense ontology declaring “there are\ncomposite objects (such as chairs, trees, mountains)”; a nihilist replies: “there are no\ncomposite objects”. suppose it were conceded that the commonsensical theorist is\nuttering something true in plain english, where the domain of the existential\nquantifier ranges over ordinary objects; while the domain of quantification of the\nnihilist were restricted to simples (e.g., subatomic particles). the two contenders\nwould therefore be using two different senses of “there is”, call them “there isc” and\n“there isn”. suppose one could successfully argue that this dispute be interpreted as a\nmetalinguistic negotiation, where the parties are pragmatically communicating their\nadvocacy of “there isc” and “there isn” respectively. it would then be easy to recast the\ndispute as an explicit metalinguistic negotiation, where the commonsensical theorist\nwere proposing to use “there isc” and the nihilist were proposing to use “there isn”\nwhen discussing matters of composition.\nat this stage, the proponent of minimal anti-deflationism about the composition\ndebate may argue that this dispute: (a) could affect the parties’ ontological\ncommitments concerning parthood and material composition. for instance, were\nthe nihilistic version of english to prevail, this could result in the parties’ withdrawing\ntheir commitment to the existence of tables and chairs. additionally, it\ncould be urged that (b) the dispute is not epistemically deflatable, because each\nparty enjoys at least an internal form of justification. successfully arguing for (a)\nand (b) would imply that the dispute in question is minimally substantive. although\nmany details will have to be filled in, this brief outline already shows that a minimal\n \n  \n  '], [75, '75\nanti-deflationist project can be sensibly pursued in the composition case as well as\nin the persistence case.\nbefore closing, we should go back to the question “what can the notion of minimal\nsubstantivity do for conceptual engineers” as i anticipated, the notion of minimal\nsubstantivity can help clarify what is ontologically substantive in disputes where\nparties need not be engaged in “tracking” any fundamental aspect of reality, nor need\nto pursue a naturalistic project.\nfor instance, we might say that a debate on whether there are (or there can be)\nsame-sex marriages is ontologically substantive in a relevant, “minimal” sense,\nalthough marriage-facts are not fundamental or are not naturalizable. provided we\nhave enough evidence suggesting that the dispute is a metalinguistic negotiation, we\nmay argue that: (a) debating over whether we should use the expression “same-sex\nmarriage” can affect our ontological commitments (to types of marriages) and the\nlanguage games we play when we speak about what there is and what there is not,\nespecially with regard to marital unions (actually, these disputes have already\ncontributed to a massive change in the relevant language games. so the possibility\nclaim is easily ascertained to be true.) as to condition (b): it is arguable that the\ndispute is not epistemically deflatable either since, contra the epistemicist, there is\nindeed sufficient evidence to favour one linguistic option rather than another. for\ninstance, it seems that numerous arguments drawing on normative considerations,\nsociological studies, reports, and so on, favour use of the word “marriage” to denote\nsame-sex couples as well as heterosexual ones. similar considerations arguably apply\nto several other ontological or metaphysical disputes on matters that are neither\n“metaphysically fundamental” in sider’s favoured sense nor obviously naturalizable\nin the quinean sense, including disputes about g, w, r, b,\nr, s h, and so on.\nlast, i should stress that labelling these disputes “minimally substantive” should\nnot be understood in a demeaning sense, but simply as signalling that the dispute is\nsubstantive in a way that requires no naturalistic or realistic assumptions. if you do\nnot like the word “minimally”, you could say that the dispute is “non-naturalistically\nontologically substantive” or that it is “ontologically-committing substantive”. in\ngeneral, the idea of minimal substantivity should be compatible with a dispute being\nhighly important and worth pursuing for cultural, civil, ethical, or political reasons.\nit seems like the notion i have been delineating can fulfil this task.\nacknowledgements\nthis chapter was presented

conceptual engineering¹\nand conceptual ethics.² exactly what is the nature of the relationship between these\nterms is still fluid; but a good way to rationalize it might be this. conceptual\nengineering is the business of changing existing concepts and devising new ones.\nconceptual ethics is the business of evaluating existing concepts and ways of talking,\nalong with newly engineered ones, and making normative judgments as to whether\nthey are fit for purpose. jointly they promise reform through innovation and\nselection of how we think and talk in the pursuit of various ends—whether moral\nends, practical ends, or alethic ends.\nthought and talk are the promised targets of these conceptual reforms. i’ll set aside\ntalk for now, though i’ll come back to it. but ‘thought’ suggests—as does the word\n‘conceptual’—that at least in part concepts are a key part of the reformist’s ontology. she\nwill be engineering new ones, and recommending the adoption of some new ones, and\nthe revision or sidelining of others. but what about the concept ??????? itself? could\nthere be ways of thinking about what concepts are that are different from standard\nunderstandings, but which have benefits that the conceptual reformer might take to be\nsignificant enough to merit recommending that we think and talk in terms of them?\nthis chapter recommends such a revision, or perhaps addition, to our stock of\nideas about concepts. classical and neo-classical accounts of concepts are thought to\nbe connected in various ways to regular beliefs³—they enable us to have certain kinds\nof beliefs with certain kinds of content. the key idea in this chapter will be that there\nis a kind of mental concept which is connected to a mental state that is a little\ndifferent from the usual conception of belief. beliefs—straightforwardly in the functionalist\ntradition4 but also in many others5—are individuated by what one might call\n¹ floridi (2011); cappelen (forthcoming). ² burgess and plunkett 2013a.\n³ for a taxonomy of accounts, see chapter 1 of margolis and lawrence (1999).\n4 braddon-mitchell and jackson 2007.\n5 consider, for example, the covariational program that starts with dretske (1981) or the teleonomic\none which has perhaps its best expression in shea (2013).\n \n \n \n  '], [80, '80\ntheir ‘input’ conditions. at its crudest these are just what distally causes them, but\nvarious traditions include what they co-vary with, what ideally causes them, and so\non. at its most general, we might describe them as word-head connections. the\nconnection to behaviour (and thus the head-world connection) is purely via their\ninteraction with desires: distinct states which interact with beliefs to produce\nbehaviour.\nlet me give a motivating example which i will discuss later: an unspeakable word\nand associated concept which, in the case of racist speech in my culture (i’m an\nanglo-celtic australian), represents an indigenous person. in order not to distract by\nmentioning the word (mention sometimes has spillover effects from use) i’ll pretend\nthat word is “arthur” and the corresponding concept a?????. what’s racist about\nit? it’s not just linguistic. it’s that corresponding to that word there is a racist\nconcept—or at least a mental entity in the concept family. and that mental entity\ndoes not merely represent skin colour or information about ancestry. rather, it’s one\nwhich when tokened itself directly causes negative affect of a range of types, which in\nturn both directly and indirectly motivates discrimination and other behaviours;\nnone of this happens indirectly via discrete racist beliefs of the form ‘arthurs are lazy’\nand so forth. recognizing that there are such mental entities in the concept family\ngives us the power to challenge them. if there is such a concept it’s not one we should\npossess (although this chapter is of course asking you to possess the concept of such a\nconcept—more on that distinction later as well). perhaps, too, it will be explanatory:\ncertain kinds of implicit bias may be explained by the fact that such a concept is\npossessed, even though no explicit negative beliefs are held, and the concept may be\ngiven a linguistic label the same as the anodyne representational concept (perhaps the\ntacitly prejudiced person possesses this special kind of concept a????? while using\nthe word ‘aboriginal’.\nthis chapter will recommend, then, that we consider a kind of concept which bears\na relation like the one traditional accounts of concepts bear to beliefs, but instead\nbears it to states individuated not only by their causal inputs, but also by their direct\ncausal outputs. i’ll call these states reactive representations, rrs for short. they are\npartially representational states which are reactive inasmuch as they bypass interaction\nwith distinct desires to directly motivate behaviour. in a later section i’ll\ndiscuss how this relates to well known objections to ‘besires’: states that combine\nfeatures of beliefs and of desires.\ni will argue that there seems to be an important difference between two sorts of\nrepresentational mechanisms: ones that really do act like mere beliefs where the\nrepresentational state is discreet, and waits for a motivational state to come along and\ninteract with it, and cases where the act of recognition—the act of representing—has\nitself immediate motivational force, as in the case of ‘thick’ moral terms,6 certain sorts\nof phenomenal concepts and, i think, cases of bias and hate. when the motivating\nforce is immediate, the motivation itself becomes part of how we taxonomize the\n6 it might seem that by explaining thick moral terms and slurs in terms of concepts i’m coming down\nfirmly on the side of a debate about whether these are pragmatic or semantic phenomena (see väyrynen\n2013) for a defence of the pragmatic account). certainly that’s one way to taxonomize the view i will\ndefend. but another would be to somewhat problematize the pragmatic/semantic distinction\n\n  \n  '], [81, '81\nworld: being apt for motivating in that way is part of what makes us see something\nas falling under the concept. i’ll call a concept that is connected to an rr in the way\nan ordinary concept is connected to an ordinary belief a reactive concept, or\nr-concept. whether there are such things, as i understand them, is an empirical\nmatter which my research team is investigating. here i argue only that the hypothesis\nthat there are does a lot of explanatory work, and most importantly for current\npurposes, makes sense of the focus on the reform of concepts on normative grounds\nthat has been called conceptual ethics (burgess and plunkett 2013a,b).\n2. the r-concept hypothesis\nin this section i will first elaborate a little more on the hypothesis that there are\nr-concepts and then consider how they compare to ordinary concepts, ordinary\nbeliefs, and desires. i then go on to consider whether the idea can be easily subsumed\nby global belief-desire psychology.\n2.1. concepts, r-concepts, beliefs, and desires\nexactly what the relationship is between beliefs and desires and representational\ncontent is complicated. but for our purposes here let it be assumed that concepts are\npart of what makes it possible to possess certain beliefs or desires, or what makes it\npossible to token a representation with a certain propositional content.7 insofar as\nyou possess the concept ‘triangle’ you can token states that represent triangles. so\nperhaps to possess a concept is to possess a kind of ability. there are complications\nthat don’t matter for now: there is a tradition according to which a concept is what\nallows one to explicitly and consciously represent a certain state, others on which\nthey are required to represent something de dicto rather than merely de re (on such\nviews mental states might have non-conceptual content8). but the simple formulation\nwill do for our purposes.\nconcepts traditionally, then, fall firmly on the representational side of the mental\nfamily. if i possess the concept ‘possum’ then that is part of what it takes to be able to\nform at least de dicto beliefs about possums?. rational people require, in addition,\nevidence of various sorts to form beliefs. in the case of beliefs, possession of the\nconcept together with evidential or causal connections makes, in normal subjects,\npossession of the belief in some cases almost automatic. if i have the concept then at very least i will form the belief that it seems that there is a possum\nhere. if i take myself to be in a position to trust my perception, then i’ll form the\nbelief that there is a possum nearby.\nthe idea here is firmly attached to standard belief-desire psychology. beliefs are\nstates which when formed have no power to motivate by themselves. rather they sit\nin the head, waiting to be paired up with a state which will interlock with them. their\n7 this is close to the rough characterization in burgess and plunkett (2013a) except that it’s a necessary\ncondition, rather than a sufficient one for thought formation.\n8 see bermúdez (2007) and roskies (2008) for some up to date discussion of this idea.\n? and desires, but the point which follows about automatic production may not apply in this case.\n \n \n  '], [82, '82\nsemantic values, while they depend on the overall cause roles they play, perhaps\ntogether with desires, are invisible to the desire mechanism.¹° once the belief that, for\nexample, a possum is present is formed, a mental entity hangs around with a local\nsyntactic shape that can be recognized by desire-like objects. if the desire to be near a\npossum encounters a belief that a possum is near, then (ceteris paribus) the agent\ndoesn’t move. if it is encountered by a desire for possum flesh, quite other behaviour\nis caused.\nit is not part of the individuation condition of a belief that it causes any particular\nbehaviour; the behaviour depends entirely on the agent’s desire profile. and a\nstandard concept is, inter alia, something that is required to form beliefs.\nbut notice that it’s a contingent fact that the token physical state which is sitting\naround waiting for desires doesn’t itself directly cause behaviour. in principle there\ncould be such states; states formed by certain input conditions, which indeed might\nsit around and wait for desires, but in the meantime directly shortcut the belief-desire\nsystem to produce behaviours. there could be a state, co-varying and generally\nhaving whatever your favourite foundational semantics says makes it about possums,\nwhich directly motivates running away from possums. let’s call this state ‘ughpossum’.\nthe state itself, when formed, has the power to initiate movement away\nfrom the possum. insofar as it has belief like features, it can also combine with other\ndesires about possums (if you independently desire to sing a silly song about possums\nwhenever near one, so you will sing as you leave). but it doesn’t need any such extra\ndesire to do certain things. this token state realizes¹¹ a belief that there is a possum\nnearby. but it does not *only* realize a belief that there is a possum nearby: it has\nextra powers that not every belief that there is a possum nearby would have. a kind to\nwhich this token state belongs is not individuated by the purely representational\nsemantics, it’s individuated as well by its output powers: it’s powers to directly\nproduce behaviour. such a state is what i’m calling a reactive representation. an\nimmediate concern that you might have is that this sounds an awful lot like a besire,\nand there are well known objections to the very possibility or coherence of such\nstates. but nothing i say here depends on showing those objections don’t work, as in\nsection 4.2 i argue that in fact rrs are not besires.\nthe extension of the idea of a concept i’mrecommending here bears the same kind\nof relationship to rrs as the traditional idea of a concept does to beliefs. the rr\n‘ughpossum’ is a state which is belief like inasmuch as it responds to inputs; is\ncaused by possums; and tracks perceptual evidence of possums. but rather than\nwaiting for desires to come along and interact with it, it directly induces aversion of\nthe detected object. the r-concept is a kind of ability. it’s the ability to\nform these states. possession of the r-concept is required to have the\nability to form the rr ‘ughpossum’. and just as in the case of regular concepts,\nwhere there were conditions in which possession of the concept makes forming\nbeliefs automatic, there will be conditions in which possessing a certain r-concept\nwill make tokening the relevant rr automatic. if someone who possesses a certain\n¹° a point vigorously stressed in fodor (1987) and countless subsequent publications.\n¹¹ the reader wondering why i have said ‘realizes’ rather than ‘is’ will have her questions answered in\nsection 4.2.\n  \n  '], [83, '83\nr-concept sees presentations as of the representational features encoded in the\nr-concept then they will token the rr ughpossum, and this will\nin turn produce the downstream causal effect of fleeing the marsupial infested\nneighbourhood.\n2.2. comparison with standard accounts of concepts\nso in using r-concepts to taxonomize the mind we will draw distinctions differently.\ntwo concepts that have the same input conditions will count as the same ordinary\nintensional concept. but if two states which have the same input conditions, but one\ngives the capacity to form regular beliefs, and the other gives the capacity to produce\nrrs which bypass the standard desire mechanisms to motivate behaviour, they count\nas different along the r-concept dimension. is there any motivation to use the term\n‘concept’ for r-concepts at all, rather than engineering an entirely different term for\nthis sort of mental entity?\nthere are plenty of prima facie reasons for using the word ‘concept’ here: clarity,\nease of explanation, and so on. but another is that we already need to vary the\nstandard intensional individuation of concepts to explain mental phenomena which\nare amongst those whose explanation it is the job of a theory of concepts to provide.\nordinary concepts are often thought to be fully individuated by their input\nconditions—or at least what it takes to fall under them is. but something other\nthan the ‘ordinary’ idea of individuation of concepts by the features of the things\nwhich makes them fall under that concept may already be needed to account for\nmerely hyperintensionally distinct concepts.¹² some such hyperintensional distinctions\nmight, for example, be marked by method of detection, rather than features\nrequired for the thing to fall under the concept. it takes the same features in the world\nfor something to count as falling under and, but one can\nimagine someone disposed to try to identify these figures by counting angles insofar\nas she is deploying the concept, and angles insofar as she is deploying.\nso are and the same concept or are they different concepts?\nsurely there is no need to make that call: they are intensionally the same but\nhyperintensionally distinct. if one wanted terminology, one could say they are\nsame concept but different h-concept (friends of the hyperintensional often like to\nthink that concepts are individuated hyperintensionally, and they use another world\nfor intensional concepts, but that’s a fight about words).\nthis seems to be the right thing to say in this case, and no-one i know of has\nsuggested that insofar as concepts are hyperintensionally distinct they are not\nconceptually distinct in some sense (if anything, as above, the other move is more\noften heard—that concepts are hyperintensional through and through, and that\nintensional distinctions are coarser grained than the usual conceptual ones). and if\nit is the right thing to say in this case, then it seems to apply to the case of r-concepts\nas well. for here also we have intensionally (and maybe hyperintensionally) distinct\n¹² for a sketch of an account of this that does not invoke metaphysically robust impossibilities, see\nbraddon-mitchell (2009).\n \n  '], [84, '84\nstates, which because they function causally in slightly different ways, get to count as\ndifferent in a different dimension from the intensional or hyperintensional.\n2.3. r-concepts versus belief desire psychology with irrationality\nor a divided mind\nso if the distinction between r-concepts and standard concepts is a good one, the\neasy job of saying that they deserve to be thought of as a kind of concept is done. but\nour comparison with standard accounts of the relationship between beliefs and\nconcepts is not yet done. for there is a danger that r-concepts and rrs might be\nredundant given the way belief-desire psychology is often understood.\nso far i have introduced the idea of rrs in terms of the different behaviour of\ntoken concepts. the thought is that there are tokens of the required types in the head,\nand there is a difference in behaviour between rrs and standard beliefs. standard\nbeliefs stand as if at a dance, looking for a desire partner with whom to generate\nbehaviours. rrs do the work themselves, as it were, without a partner.\nbut on a global conception of belief-desire psychology this doesn’t make sense. on\nthis conception, thinkers don’t have individual beliefs and desires. rather they have\nglobal input output profiles, complete belief-desire states (braddon-mitchell and\njackson 2003: chapter 3). individual beliefs (or desires) only make sense as abstractions\nthat describe the minimal differences between global states.\non this conception having the r-concept is indistinguishable from\nhaving an overall belief-desire profile which includes the belief that there are possums\naround, and a desire to vacate the possum rich environment. for you are globally set\nup such that when you encounter possums you flee them.\nfor many purposes that’s the right conception of belief and desire, in my view. but\ni’m less sure than i once was that it’s always the most useful conception. in particular,\nit doesn’t play well with typical actual behavioural profiles in that it can’t make sense\nof irrationality.\nsuppose, for example, that you are disposed to apparently randomly flee possums\nor not. it turns out that what is going on is that you approve of possums; you have\na standing desire to observe them. but nonetheless you possess the\nr-concept, so your categorization process produces an immediate impulse to flee.\nat times when you are reflective, you overcome this because of your desire to observe\nand be in the company of possums. at other times you just react unreflectively and\nflee the neighbourhood. or consider someone who sincerely claims that certain\nbehaviours are likely to cause eternal torture, who sincerely believes that infinite\ntorture massively outweighs fleeting pleasure, yet performs behaviours which would,\nif this were true, bring about the infinite pain and only modest pleasure—and does all\nthis with only modest regret. the global story here has unilluminating fixes:¹³ you\nhave context dependent desires (you desire-when-reflective to be with possums, you\ndesire-when-unreflective to avoid them) or the divided mind hypothesis (lewis 1982;\nstalnaker 1984; davidson 2004; egan 2008). it’s unsurprising that these are a little\nunilluminating about the exact behaviour of mental states in less that perfectly\n¹³ for a nice account of the ways in which these are unilluminating, see norby (2014). \n  '], [85, '85\nrational beings like us: for all of these fixes are not designed to taxonomize the mind\nin terms of token states, but rather to preserve global accounts of the way the mind is,\nremoving contradiction either by creating two separate consistent accounts (the\nfragmentation story), or one in which our desires and perhaps beliefs are so massively\ncontext dependent they don’t play the kinds of roles in our ordinary discourse that\nthey were intended to (e.g., a desire-when-reflective as against a desire-when-unreflective,\nor a belief-when-talking-about-the-act as against a belief-when-acting).\nwhen we aren’t talking about an abstract global theory of what it is to be a rational\nbeing (for which global belief-desire theory seems eminently suited) but rather\ninterested in token explanations, the hypothesis that sometimes a single token state\nboth motivates and represents, and at other times the work is divided between\ndistinct token states, is both illuminating and empirically tractable. it seems to\nexplain a lot if true, and it shouldn’t be beyond our powers to find out if it is true.\n3. general explanatory benefits of r-concepts\nincluding ones for conceptual ethics\nin this section i argue that, if the r-concept hypothesis is correct, it would not only\nprovide direct benefits in explaining the importance of conceptual ethics but would\nalso provide general explanatory benefits.\n3.1. three unified benefits: hate speech, crypto-evaluative terms,\nphenomenal concepts\nhere’s another benefit of the idea of the r-concept. it provides a unity of explanation\nover a range of three apparently very different areas. i’ll briefly survey the advantages\nthat this story might have in each of the areas, suggesting that the unity over the areas\nit brings is a theoretical advantage, and that in each case understanding that there are\nr-concepts involved makes better sense of the projects of conceptual engineering and\nconceptual ethics in these domains.\n\ni’ve already given the example of hate speech: here the idea is that to hate speech\nthere might correspond hate r-concepts; which give you token states which both\nrepresent the external world a certain way, and cause you to react in a certain way.\nthat the reaction is so immediate also gives the impression that being apt for the\nreaction is part of what it takes to fall under the r-concept. so if we wanted a\ntheory of content for r-concepts, then this would likely come with the territory. the\nr-concept causes you to token states which represent indigenous australians,\nto respond in a certain way and also to form the view of them being represented as\nrightly producing that response. you do not truly fall under that concept, the racist is\nlikely to think, unless you are deserving of the response. this makes richer sense of\nthe recommendation that a practitioner of conceptual ethics might be doing when\nshe recommends against using the word “arthur”. if it was just an issue of the word\nthen the focus seems to be on two possible worries. one is not using the word because\nit gives offence. this is a weak justification for two reasons. one is that there is a\n \n  '], [86, '86\nliberal conception of offence as a very weak kind of harm, which hardly justifies\nrestriction of this kind of speech unless we extend the harm into a kind of verbal\nviolence. perhaps a reasonable move, but not an uncontroversial one. the other is\nthat it gives evidence of racist attitudes on the part of the speaker. but this would\nbe superficial evidence: if the underlying concept is just the same as the representational\nconcept “aboriginal” the only racism is being careless with possible\noffence. but the intuition many have is that it’s not an unqualified benefit to\nhave racists hide their colours by careful choice of words. so there’s something\nmore going on than just choice of words. on the r-concept story, though, it is\nindeed evidence: but one which shows that the user of the word may possess a\ncertain r-concept, something which other things being equal disposes them to\nprejudicial action. and making a recommendation against such a concept, even to\nsomeone in the grip of it, might sometimes help. seeing how hard it is not to talk\nin those terms, she can become aware of it and, if in respect of her considered\ndesires they are reasonable, she may try to remove the concept from her mental\nrepertoire. i discuss in section 3.3 the prospects for finding a connection between\nuse of words and r-concepts.\nperhaps here a few words are appropriate to discuss the extent to which\naccepting my view requires you to take sides on existing views about pejorative\nlanguage. you might think that my view, tied as it is to r-concepts, falls firmly on\nthe side of analyses which place the emphasis on the content of the expressions\n(see, e.g., hom 2008). but that of course depends on what you mean by ‘content’.\ni talk of the ‘content’ of r-concepts, and call r-concepts a kind of concept because\ni think that there are similarities in the way these notions do explanatory work to\npurely descriptive concepts and contents. but of course it’s an extension of both\nideas. and as such it’s ultimately terminological (though not therefore unimportant)\nwhether the extensions deserve the original terms. another way of using the\nideas i propose would be to accept that the mental entities i call “r-concepts”\nexist, and think of them as the underlying mechanisms that explain much of the\npragmatics of thought and talk. the view is inconsistent, though, with any account\naccording to which there is nothing mental that distinguishes what’s going on in\nthese cases from cases where there is no pejorative or hateful language. a very flatfooted\nversion of anderson and lepore’s view in their (2013) according to which\nthe fact that the words are taboo is the only explanatory factor would be inconsistent\nwith it, and the explanation would be entirely outside the head of the user.\nfinally, much of the literature concentrates on things that have speech does. there\nis a tendency in philosophy, as elsewhere, to promote single factor explanations,\nso that the promoter—should she win—gets to have a monopoly on being right.\nto the extent that linguistic behaviour has many important effects, one might\nthink that this should flourish. so, for example, camp’s view (2013) that pejorative\nlanguage serves to signal alignment with a certain perspective is something, which\nif just baldly stated like that is likely often true, and certainly consistent with what\ni say. even stronger versions of it—such as the view that the distal explanation of\nits prevalence is to do with such signalling—are more empirically risky, but also\nconsistent. what isn’t consistent would be the view that none of the proximal\npsychology is as i describe.\n \n  '], [87, '87\nat first blush, it might seem as though phenomenal concepts have very little to do\nwith the topics we have been discussing. but i think that r-concepts explain\nimportant features of them as well. consider a discussion which went on over\nmany years between me and my friend the sadly late philosopher jonathan\nmckeown-green. jonathan was blind from birth, and as a philosopher interested\nin perception, he was a natural person to talk to about colour concepts. at some level\nhe thought he couldn’t possibly have the same concept that i had. but intensionally\nhe possessed a concept (let’s call it red-j) that was identical to mine: let’s say\nit tracked a certain reflectance profile. and yet, he and i thought, it wasn’t the same\nconcept.\nwhen there is similarity at the intensional level, but difference of concept, you\nmight diagnose hyperintensionality. but that’s not what’s going on here. if one of our\nconcepts was hyperintensional, it would categorize in a more fine grained way. but\nthere’s nothing more fine grained here in either of our concepts.\nperhaps it’s response dependence that’s at issue (pettit 1991). but moving to a\ntypical response dependent conception doesn’t help either. if is to be characterized\nas “apt in normal conditions to produce response r in species-typical individuals”\nthen again we have an ordinary intensional concept, and something that\njonathan and i could agree on, while not dispelling the sense that we don’t possess\nthe same concept—that somehow, while we agree on this, he didn’t understand what\nsighted people mean by a term like ‘red’.\nbut notice that there is an r-concept and rr in the neighbourhood. recall that an\nrr is something which is responsive to information about the world, but part of its\nindividuation is via not just those inputs, but its outputs—the things it causes. so far\nthe outputs we have considered are ones of reactive attitudes and behaviours. but\nreactive phenomenologies are just yet more causes.¹4 to possess the r-concept is\nto possess a capacity (and perhaps a disposition) to token the rr ‘red’. the rr ‘red’ is\ntokened when the agent receives certain information about the world¹5 but also has\nthe effect of producing the phenomenology.¹6\nthis, then, is something jonathan and i do not share. he does not possess the\nr-concept as he does not possess the ability to token the rr ‘red’, even though\nhe does share the intensional concept. the r-concept has as a feature an\neffect on what it takes to be in this sense—that is, had produced this effect in me.\nso while there is a sense (derived from the intensional concept) in which we can\n¹4 by phenomenologies here i don’t mean anything substantive. if you are a dualist who believes in rich\nqualia, let them be the causal product of tokening certain rrs. if you are at the other extreme, and think it’s\nall about dispositions to make verbal claims about experience, let those dispositions be possessed by the\nrr. and for every positions in between the same can be said.\n¹5 if this were a chapter about phenomenal concepts, then some discussion of whether the input\nchannels are relevant here would be appropriate—maybe it makes a difference if it is tokened by the\nperceptual system.\n¹6 there are interesting issues here about how integrated an rr has to be. perhaps empirically we may\nfind the cause of phenomenal component in the perceptual system, and the cognitive component\nelsewhere. and yet somehow there is a “binding” of the two. the bound pair might be thought to be a\ncause of the phenomenology, but possibly not the cognitive component alone.\n \n  '], [88, '88\nboth judge that some flower is red (me by looking, he by consulting a colour meter)\nthere is another in which he cannot judge that it’s red in the same way as me. \nfinally a certain kind of puzzle in giving an account of certain concepts is explicable if\nthere are r-concepts in the vicinity. these are concepts i call ‘crypto-evaluative’.\nthey might include and many others. i call them\ncrypto-evaluative because on the surface they seem amenable to analysis in terms of\nwhat features of the world are required for them. we might, for example, give a story\nabout what decision making processes count as democratic. but they are all vulnerable\nto normative objections that expose the hidden evaluate features. suppose an\nagent considers an excellent account of what democratic decision making amounts to\n(and thinks herself a democrat) but judges that that’s not a good way to organize\nsociety. likely she will make the ‘true democracy’ move: she will be less inclined to\njudge that that procedure really is democratic.\nconsider the debate about the concept of happiness. various descriptive accounts\nof happiness—ones which feature objective lists, or which feature psychological\nstates—have been criticized on the grounds that these things could in principle\nturn out to be undesirable. (nozick 19'], [89, '89; nussbaum 2008). the obvious alternative\nis explicitly normative accounts: happiness is the greatest prudential good, or happiness\nis flourishing of some kind. these in turn are criticized as leaving out a\nsubstantial account of what happiness is (haybron 2008; feldman 2010). (maybe\nthe concept is one which is committed to mental ease, or some other psychological\nstate, as part of what it takes to be happy—no-one is happy, such a response goes,\nhowever much she has the objective list if she is miserable.)\nif there is an r-concept to be had (perhaps in addition to a standard\none) then what that r-concept amounts to is the ability to form the rr ‘happiness’.\nand, perhaps, the rr ‘happiness’ is tokened when there is a state which is caused by\n(or otherwise represents) some list of features—perhaps in this case internal psychological\nones, perhaps also elements of an objective list—but which also causes\nmotivation towards these features. so no-one would judge that she is happy (insofar\nas the r-concept is playing a role in the judgement) unless her representation of these\nstates motivated her towards it. thus we get an explanation of how someone can both\nbe prone to think that there is substantial empirical content to the concept of\nhappiness, and yet be drawn to the idea that some normative features are essential\nto it. crytpo-evaluative concepts are just r-concepts.\ni’ll add one very brief speculation. a lot has been written about implicit bias; bias\nwhere agents seem to have both explicit beliefs and explicit desires which don’t\nappear to have any bias towards a group of people. and yet, the agent behaves in a\nbiased way: perhaps being more inclined to vote against someone from a minority\ngroup in a job selection, for example. one hypothesis worth testing would be that\nr-concepts are involved here. if the biased motivation is part of the r-concept—a\ndirect causal product of the representation—and not a result of stand alone desires\nmetaphorically looking for beliefs to pair with, then it’s more likely that such a\n \n  89\npattern might be something the agent herself could miss when interrogating her\ndiscreet beliefs and desires. there may be no stand alone desire not to see members\nof that group employed, and no stand alone belief that they shouldn’t be, but the\nr-concept makes it likely that, confronted by members of a group, an rr will be\nformed which directly causes the biased behaviour.\n3.2. conceptual difference where there is no disagreement about fact\nso far i have done some setup about the idea of the r-concept, and discussed some of\nbenefits of having the notion to hand. in this section i’ll talk about another case that\ni think makes r-concepts worth exploring for conceptual engineers.\nsometimes there seem to be disagreements which matter a lot, but which don’t\nseem to depend on any disagreement of fact.\nconsider the concept of ‘survival’¹7 it’s very contentious what exactly survival\namounts to. i’m tempted myself to think that it’s a difficult notion, which admits of\ndegree (braddon-mitchell and miller ms). but for current purposes we need only\nconsider two alternatives; a physical continuity theory and a psychological continuity\ntheory. the simple physical continuity theory is just one that says you survive over\nsome interval iff you are related to the entity at the end of the interval by the ancestral\nof the physical similarly relation. that relation in turn holds when there is object\ncausally connected to you which overlaps with your current self physically to a very\nhigh degree. the psychological continuity theory is much the same, substituting\npsychological similarity for physical similarity. it’s usually assumed that our account\nof psychological similarity is one which allows psychological similarity across discontinuous\nphysical change—as with material destruction followed by reconstruction,\nor downloading.\nit’s notorious that people disagree vigorously about the plausibility of these two\ntheories, which in part is what makes them good things to discuss in introductory\ncourses.\ni’ve tracked the opinions of undergraduate students on these topics for a number\nof years, and found that roughly speaking 40% of classes of 400 students or so are\nattracted to psychological continuity theories, and 45% or so are attracted to physical\ncontinuity theories, at least insofar as they take this difference to explain their\ndifferent reaction to teletransporter cases.\nthe well known teletransporter cases are ones where there is bodily destruction\nbut recording of the psychological information, followed by bodily recreation at a\ndistant location, down to the relevant degree of detail required for the psychological\ninformation to be preserved.\nthose who are attracted to the psychological continuity theory say that teletransporters,\nshould they come to exist, will provide painless easy travel, and will be\nhappy to use them if the price is right. physical continuity theorists are genuinely\nbaffled by this, and tend to scream at their fellow students of the other persuasion\n“you don’t get it: you are being paid money to be killed”.\n¹7 the locus classicus is of course parfit (1984).\n \n  '], [90, '90\nnow the question that i’m hoping r-concepts can help with is this: what is the\ndisagreement about?\nthis question arises because it is possible to divide up the sample of students in\nways that factor out obvious sources of disagreement.\nhere are some obvious sources:\n(1) perhaps some students believe in souls, and really hold a soul continuity\ntheory. but they think that souls are directly connected to bodies, at least\ninsofar as boldly destruction severs the soul from the earth.\n(2) perhaps some students are dualists, and they think that no matter what i try to\ntell them about how a recreated brain will support consciousness, they don’t\naccept this, and thus think they’ll no longer exist after teletransportation,\nbecause there’ll be no experience.\n(3) perhaps students think that there are substantive metaphysical facts about\nwhat survival is grounded in. survival is worth having, they think, and it is a\nnatural feature of the world (other things people might call survival are mere\ngerrymandered things of no interest) and the job of metaphysics is to find\nwhat grounds survival: so these two possible candidates, the two continuity\ntheories, are alternative accounts of what the grounds of survival are. the\ndisagreement is about the metaphysical fact about the nature of the grounds of\nsurvival.\nso in order to eliminate these possibilities as sources of disagreement, i excluded\nfrom my sample people who believe in souls, people who are dualists, and people who\nbelieve in grounding. each of these groups have an answer to what the disagreement\nof fact might still obtain between people who agree on the fundamental physical\nfacts. the people who believe in souls think that while we might agree about the\nphysical body and its constituents, there is something else—the soul—which might\nor might not be present, and we could be tacitly disagreeing about that (your body\nwill survive, and your brain, but not your soul). dualists, very similarly, might take\nthe view that the dualistic component of the mental may survive some (identity\npreserving) physical changes, but not others. and finally, these undergraduates were\ntaught about metaphysical grounding: the version in which grounded entities are\nontologically distinct yet grounded in underlying physical nature. on many such\nviews it’s a substantial metaphysical fact which fundamental states ground the nonfundamental,\nand if persons are non-fundamental, there can be a substantial disagreement\nas to which physical states ground them.\non eliminating these people whose views take them to think there is a substantial\ndisagreement there was only a slight change. of the remaining group (luckily for\ncurrent purposes my university is in a culture with few soul believers amongst\nundergraduates) the split is now about even. and now the puzzle is more serious.\nall of them agree, for the sake of the example, on all the base metaphysical facts. they\nagree about the nature of physical continuity. they agree about the nature of\npsychological continuity. they agree about background physics and science more\ngenerally insofar as it is relevant. they agree that there are no substantial grounding\nrelations which connect more abstract things like ‘grounding’ with the basic facts in\nthe universe. so what is left?\n \n  '], [91, '91\nthe remaining obvious possibility is something like merely verbal or lexical\ndisagreement. they disagree about what ‘survival’ means. but that seems too thin a\nthing to justify the reactions. the physical continuity theorists still hold that it’s mad\nand bad to teletransport, because it doesn’t preserve survival. if it were a mere lexical\ndisagreement, then you’d expect that it could be solved by dictionary makers. and yet\nno physical continuity theorist thinks she would be dissuaded by the discovery\nthat the oed says that the psychological continuity theory is the right definition\nof the english word ‘survival’. indeed, not all physical continuity theorists think that\ntheir own theory does give the right account of the english word, or that it matters\nthat it does.\nparallel with a lexical story is what one might call a “mere” conceptual story. the\ndisagreement is about which concept to possess. but the problem with this is that\nboth parties already possess both concepts. neither party thinks that one shouldn’t\npossess the other concept. indeed the physical continuity theorist couldn’t think\nabout what she is right about were it not for the fact that she possessed the concept\n‘the thing that is preserved in psychological continuity, and that pc theorists call\n“survival”’.\nso what is the disagreement about, if it’s not fundamental metaphysics, grounding,\nsemantics, or concepts?\nwell of course the striking difference is a difference that looks like it’s not one of\nbelief, but of motivation. the psychological continuity theorist is very much motivated\nto preserve psychological continuity at almost any cost. the physical continuity\ntheorist is similarly motivated with respect to physical continuity.\nso what’s going on here might be the possession of different r-concepts.\nthe teletransporters (those who believe they survive teletransportation) have an\nr-concept which takes facts about psychological similarity as input, and directly\nmotivates behaviour seeking psychological similarity at all costs. the others have an\nr-concept which takes facts about physical similarity as input, and similarly motivates\nbehaviour seeking physical similarity at all costs. the first category is motivated\nto provide benefits to their psychological successors; the second will only be so\nmotivated if they are physical continuers.\nhow does the r-concepts strategy help? if it were merely a matter of each side\nusing different ordinary concepts, it would be still mysterious. for as i will explain in\nsection 4.1, successful explication of an ordinary concept to an agent entails it’s\npossession by that agent, so both sides would possess both concepts. but as we will\nsee, r-concepts are different: you can explain the r-concept successfully to\nsomeone without that person thereby possessing it (even if she possesses a kind of\nmeta-concept, as we will see). so it’s quite possible for the groups to possess different\nr-concepts, for this to explain the difference, and for that fact not to change even\nwhen we explain the idea of the r-concepts to both sides.\n3.3. r-concepts and words: how to engineer r-concepts\na principal part of the justification for a theory of r-concepts is not just that it’s a\nbetter way to taxonomize parts of our cognitive economy, but that it helps in the task\nof conceptual revision under the guidance of conceptual ethics.\n\n  '], [92, '92\nthe thought so far is that it gives us as conceptual ethicists a story of why certain\nr-concepts are bad ones, and as engineers, a motivation to engineer new ones and try\nto persuade people to adopt them.\nbut short of as yet practically impossible, and likely highly immoral, direct neural\nintervention with our conceptual structures, the principal handle we have on our\nconceptual life—at least our more complicated concepts—is via words. so it may pay\nto consider the relationship between concepts and words, and r-concepts and words.\nthe use of words amongst those who understand them tends to token the concept\nrequired for their understanding. if i say to you “be alert for triangles” you’ll be more\nlikely to look at your environment in a way which is alert to their presence, and thus\nform beliefs that there are (or aren’t) triangles in the area.\nthe interesting question for our current concerns is how the word-concept pairing\nworks in the case of r-concepts. i suggested earlier that r-concepts may play an\nexplanatory role in the case of thick moral concepts. the question remains whether\nthe word-concept pairing is sufficiently robust that influencing verbal behaviour\ncan be part of an intervention strategy to minimize the harmful effects of harmful\nr-concepts.\nif it were, then we should expect something like this. the word “arthur” is\nassociated with the r-concept the phrase “indigenous person” is associated\nwith the r-concept. if you ask someone (who is neither a\ncommitted racist nor alert to conceptual and linguistic contributions to discrimination\nand oppression) to “look out for arthurs” then, on sighting an indigenous\nperson, you might expect her to be more likely to form an rr with the content which in turn produces automatic fear responses and general negative\naffect. if on the other hand she is primed differently, and asked to look out for\nindigenous people, then on sighting such a person, you might expect her to be more\nlikely to token a representation only of the regular concept, and\nthus have more neutral responses.\nof course all of this is tricky, since word-concept pairings are not entirely robust.\nperhaps part of what it is to be a committed racist, aside from explicitly held racist\nbeliefs, is to have the racist concept so firmly entrenched that all words for\nindigenous people will token representations with the content, either\ndirectly or via a very short chain of inference.\nthis, of course, is a second empirical matter concerning r-concepts which needs\ninvestigating: not only the crucial one of whether we actually possess them, but also\nthe way in which the tokening of rrs under their influence is, or is not, mediated by\nrelated words.\nthis is perhaps a good point to add one further speculation. a lot has been written\nabout implicit bias; bias where agents seem to have both explicit beliefs and explicit\ndesires which don’t appear to have any bias towards a group of people. and yet, the\nagent behaves in a biased way: perhaps being more inclined to vote against someone\nfrom a minority group in a job selection, for example. one hypothesis worth testing\nwould be that r-concepts are involved here. if the biased motivation is part of the\nr-concept—a direct causal product of the representation—and not a result of stand\nalone desires metaphorically looking for beliefs to pair with, then it’s more likely that\n \n  '], [93, '93\nsuch a pattern might be something the agent herself could miss when interrogating\nher discreet beliefs and desires. there may be no stand alone desire not to see\nmembers of that group employed, and no stand alone belief that they shouldn’t be,\nbut the r-concept makes it likely that, confronted by members of a group, an rr will\nbe formed which directly causes the biased behaviour.\n4. two objections to the theory of r-concepts\n4.1. failing to possess the concept and failing to understand the concept\nhere is a prima facie puzzle. with regular, purely representational concepts, understanding\na concept is roughly equivalent to possessing a concept. once i understand\nthat the concept of is the concept of a plane figure with three sides, it\nfollows that i automatically possess the concept. understanding what that concept is\ngives me that concept. so by understanding what the concept is, i will end\nup with any of the powers that are associated with the concept: the ability to form\nthoughts about triangles, for example. by understanding the concept\ni come to possess the concept, and form the ability to form thoughts about them. but\nby understanding the r-concept we do not, we hope, thereby possess it, and\ndo not have the ability to form the relevant rr. this fact might make one think that\nan r-concept is not really behaving like a concept.\nit is helpful here to distinguish between a concept, and a meta-concept: the\nconcept of that concept. in the case of ordinary concepts they are distinct, but for\nmost purposes that distinctness doesn’t matter. the meta-concept of triangle is, for\nexample, the concept of some kind of mental entity or power that enables one to form\nthoughts about three sided plane figures. that’s not the same as the first order\nconcept. but acquiring the meta-concept is sufficient for acquiring the\nconcept, so it rarely matters. perhaps it matters in animal cognition or developmental\npsychology, where plausibly some animals, and humans at some stages of development,\ncan possess concepts but not meta-concepts.\nbut the distinction matters here in realm of r-concepts. a possible complaint\nabout the idea of an r-concept is that the idea that we might be able to resist such\nconcepts is absurd—conceptual engineering will never be able to bring it about that\nwe do not have these concepts, especially not if we go about explaining them. for\ntypically, to explain a concept successfully is to bring it about that the person to\nwhom you have explained it possesses the concept. if i do a really good job of\nexplaining an alien concept to someone, perhaps the concept associated with the\ndanish word “hygge”—a concept of cosiness and domestic wintry comfort which is\nat the time of writing fashionably held to be a key contributor to wellbeing—then\ni will have succeeded insofar as she now possesses the concept. so if i somehow\nexplain the r-concept or the r-concept perhaps associated with the word\nfor which “the n word” is a euphemism—then it might seem that i will bring about\nits possession. then, as an objection, this can cut one of two ways. either this is true,\nand so there’s no benefit to talking about r-concepts, or else it’s an objection to the\npossibility of there being any such thing as an r-concept.\n \n  '], [94, '94\nthe latter horn of the dilemma goes this way:\n(1) (premise) if r-concepts are concepts then explanation will result in\npossession.\n(2) (premise) possession of r-concepts has motivational force and casual power.\n(3) (premise) mere explanation cannot bring about by itself motivational force.\n(4) (from (2) and (3)) explanation will not bring about possession of r-concepts.\n(5) (conclusion—from (4) and (1)) r-concepts are not concepts.\nthe conclusion comes from applying modus pollens to the conditional in the first\npremise. but of course this is not a compulsory move. instead we should consider\nhow generally true the first premise is.\nwe saw that the first premise is indeed true of purely representational concepts.\nbut it is not true of r-concepts. but this is because the relationship between first\norder concepts and meta-concepts is different in the case of r-concepts.\nmere explanation about the nature of an r-concept will create a meta-concept. but\nit will be a purely representational meta-concept. not an r-concept. and purely\nrepresentation meta-concepts do not have the automatic power to create the first\norder r-concepts they represent, in the way that they do have the power to create first\norder representational concepts.\nconsider our racist example again. giving lots of information about the r-concept will tell someone that there is a mental state which responds to evidence of\naboriginality, which is able to interact with standing beliefs and desires, but that\nwithout any such interaction motivates fear, distrust, and dislike. this information\ncreates in a comprehending recipient, a concept, for sure. it creates a concept (a\nrepresentational concept) of the r-concept. so it’s a representational metaconcept.\nbut having the concept of such a concept does not allow you to form\nthoughts of the kind “there’s an arthur”. because thoughts of that kind require\nyou to have an rr, usually brought about by having the r-concept. and\nindeed nothing purely informational will bring that about. of course there are meta\nr-concepts too: these might be concepts of r-concepts which come with built in\nmotivational force for the acquisition of the first order r-concept. perhaps these\nsorts of meta r-concepts may have some power to bring about possession of the\nr-concept, but these meta r-concepts cannot be acquired by purely informational\nmeans either.\nso premise (1) should be rejected. it’s not true of all concepts that explanation of\nthem results in possession of them. of course this does show that there is a difference\nbetween purely representational concepts of which this may be true, and r-concepts\nfor which it is false. but that’s unsurprising. r-concepts are different from regular\nconcepts, and this difference exactly tracks the key, motivational, difference.\n4.2. reactive representations and besires\nthere is a substantial body of literature which denies the possibility of so-called\nbesires: states which are both beliefs and desires (e.g., lewis 1988, 1996; price 1989;\nsmith 1994; zangwell 2008). r-concepts are defined in terms of reactive representations:\nand rrs at first blush look like they play both the belief role and the desire role.\n \n \n  '], [95, '95\nthis would make them a kind of besire. there can be no r-concepts without rrs, so\nif there are no besires, there are no r-concepts.\nlet’s lay this out:\n(1) (premise) r-concepts are defined in terms of rrs.\n(2) (from 1) if there are no rrs there are no r-concepts.\n(3) (premise) rrs are a kind of besire.\n(4) (premise from the besires literature) besires are impossible.\n(5) (3 and 4) there are no rrs.\n(6) (conclusion from 5 and 2) there are no r-concepts.\nit is far from uncontroversial that premise (4) is true. the besires literature is\nloaded with arguments for and against the possibility of besires. but i’m going to\naccept the premise: partly because i believe it to be true, and partly it puts my\nsuggestion in a dialectically better position if it’s compatible with the impossibility\nof besires.\nthe strategy i’ll adopt is perhaps surprising. i’ll deny premise (3) which says that\nreactive representations are a kind of besire.\nreactive representations certainly play some the causal roles that beliefs and\ndesires do. but recall that a besire is supposed to be both a belief and a desire.\nimportantly, as i hope to make clear, it’s a type of state that is both a belief with a\ncertain content and desire with certain content. this is in contrast with the idea that\nthere might be a token state which is both a belief and a desire.\nto see this consider this characterization by smith of the problem that besires pose\nfor humeans:\nw]hat humeans must deny and do deny is simply that agents who are in belief- like states and\ndesire-like states are ever in a single, unitary, kind of state. . . . and their argument for this\nclaim is really quite simple. it is that it is always at least possible for agents who are in some\nparticular belief-like state not to be in some particular desire-like state; that the two can always\nbe pulled apart, at least modally. this according to humeans, is why they are distinct\nexistences. (smith 1994: 119)\nthe thought here is that if you are in a belief-like state, there is no necessary\nconnection to any desire-like state. if i believe that there are possums around me, and\ni desire to flee, it’s always (logically) possible for me to be in the same belief state but\nsome other desire state: perhaps wanting to cuddle them. but if the belief that\npossums are around, and the desire to flee, are the very same state—a besire which\nis both a belief and a desire—then that isn’t logically possible. for this state (which is\nthe belief that possums are around) is in part individuated by also being the desire to\nflee possums. should i no longer desire to flee possums, i am no longer in the same\nstate: so i no longer have the belief that there are possums around. this violates the\nhumean doctrine that for any belief, i may combine it with any desire.\nthis is a doctrine i subscribe to, so this thought should affect me. and it does. if\nbesires are both beliefs and desires in the sense that the belief that p and the desire\nthat q could both be type identical to a particular state which has belief-like features\nand desire-like features, then i am persuaded that there are none.\n \n  '], [96, '96\ndavid lewis’ more complicated arguments (lewis 1988, 1996), which i shan’t\ndiscuss in detail here, nevertheless depend i think on a similar thought. the rules for\nevolution of beliefs and desires are different. by “rules” here we mean something like\nthe patterns of evolution which are constitutive of being a belief or a desire. if there is\none state which is both a belief and desire in this type sense, the rules of evolution for\nbelief allow it to change in a way which has no effect on its motivational aspects. but\nthat means it’s still the same desire—except it isn’t, because desires were meant to be\nidentical to states which have the representational features we have evolved away\nfrom. similarly the rules for evolution of desire allow us to evolve away from our\ndesire profile without affecting the world-head aspect of the state. since the worldhead\naspects have not changed, we have the same original belief. but by hypothesis\nour desires have evolved, so we do not possess the same desire. but the original belief\nwe possessed was supposed to be identical with this desire, so we cannot have the\noriginal belief and fail to possess the desires. so the desired hypothesis in its most flat\nfooted form leads to contradiction. so that’s why there can’t be any besires, if by\nbesire you mean a type of state that is both a certain belief and a certain desire, and by\n“is both a certain belief and a certain desire” you mean type identical to both. but are\nreactive representations besires?\nno. because they aren’t type identical to beliefs or desires. consider the reactive\nrepresentation ‘ughpossum’. someone who tokens it perhaps does token, in belief\nand desire terms, the belief there is a possum and the desire to run away.¹8 so\n‘ughpossum’ plays a role, perhaps, of being the realizer of the belief that there\nis a possum, and the desire to avoid possums. but it is not type identical to either.\nshould we evolve in such a way that we no longer take there to be possums around,\nbut are still disposed to run should there be some, then we no longer have the belief\nthat there are possums, we no longer have the rr ughpossum but we still have the\ndesire to avoid possums, albeit now realized differently. so the rr ugpossum is\nnot identical to the desire to avoid possums, even though it may realize it on\noccasion. equally, if we remain in a state which covaries with possums, while\nsomehow coming to tolerate them, we may still be in a state which we can call a\nbelief that there are possums around, but we are no longer in ughpossum, nor do\nwe desire to avoid them. thus ughpossum is not identical to the belief that there\nare possums around, though again it may realize it from time to time.\nso a reactive representation is not type identical to any belief, or any desire. a besire,\non at least some understandings—the ones that make them problematic—is something\nthat is type identical to both a belief and a desire. thus rrs are not besires, thus premise\n3 of the above argument is false and the argument fails.\nwhy do i keep saying type identical here, as though i have a contrast in mind? if\nfact this is optional. i could just say that the rr is not identical to a belief or desire,\nbut that at some times the rr is a realizer of both the belief and desire (or perhaps\nthat some neural state realizes both the rr, the belief and the desire). when desire\n¹8 actually i’mnot sure we should say that she necessarily tokens the desire to run away. maybe she only\nhas the desire to run away if the basis for her disposition to run from possums is a more general state that is\ncapable of interacting with various different beliefs.\n \n  '], [97, '97\nevolution happens so that we no longer desire to flee possums, but still believe there\nare some, the token physical state that realized the belief that there were possums and\na desire to avoid them is no longer present, but some other physical state exists which\nrealizes the belief that there are possums without realizing the desire to avoid them.\nthe rr too no longer exists. problem solved.\nbut type identity talk, as the reader may have guessed, is useful for its contrast with\ntoken identity. exactly how much sense the type token identity distinction makes is\ncontroversial. nothing i say here depends on it being a good distinction, but i take\ntalking about it to be helpful. this is because it explains the sense in which it’s easy to\nsee that people think that any kind of talk which is even close to besire talk, is taking\nseriously the idea of a belief being identical to a desire. and if you think that, you\nmight think the same about rrs, and therefore be puzzled why the standard\nobjections to besires don’t apply.\nhere then is the thought: you might think that the rr is token-identical to a token\nof the belief that possums are near, and a token of the desire to avoid possums.\nanother way of putting this is of course to say that there is just one token state: in\nvirtue of certain features it’s right to call it the rr ‘ughpossum’. in virtue of\nothers it’s right to call it a token of the belief that there are possums, in virtue of yet\nother features its right to call it a token of the desire to avoid possums. what\nhappens when that stage changes, so that, for example, it no longer serves the role\nof generating possum avoidance? the token state at one level of individuation no\nlonger exists. nor does the desire to avoid possums. but the belief that there are\npossums does, now realized by a successor token to the original one. perhaps it will\nhelp to think of the relationship between beliefs and desires and rrs as the\nunderlying token states change as something like a counterpart relation: perhaps\nanalogous to ted sider’s temporal counterpart relation (sider 2001), except rather\nthan all counterpart relations being of one kind (in sider’s case person counterparts),\nwe can help ourselves to lewis’ notion of the same thing having different\ncounterparts under different counterpart relations. so the initial state is token\nidentical to a belief (that there are possums around), a desire (to avoid possums),\nand an rr (because the connection between the representation and the behaviour is\nextremely direct. suppose the state evolves in such a way as to no longer motivate\npossum avoidance. the new state bears the belief-counterpart relation to the original\nstate (and so we say in ordinary language that the agent has the same belief) but not\nthe desire or rr counterpart. suppose the state evolves over time in a way that\nresults in the agent no longer behaving as though there is a possum around, but still\nhaving the disposition to avoid possums. the new state bears the desire counterpart\nrelation to the original state, so we say it is the same desire, but does not bear the\nbelief or rr counterpart relation. suppose the state, or the agent, evolves in such a\nway that the agent will act as though there are possums around, still is disposed to\navoid them, but that these features are less direct and automatic: the aspect of the\nagent which registers the possum has to interact cognitively with an interrogable\ndesire to avoid them to produce the behaviour. then the state bears the belief\ncounterpart relation to the original state, and the desire counterpart relation to\nthe original state, but not the rr counterpart relation. so we say she has the same\nbelief and desire, but not the same rr.\n\n  '], [98, '98\n5. conclusion\nin some ways this chapter has been an advertisement for a research programme.\nwhat the advertisement does is suggest that there will be substantial explanatory\nbenefits to the idea of an r-concept and its associated rr, and that many of these are\nof special interest to conceptual ethics and conceptual engineering. if there are such\nthings they may not only explain apparent disagreements where there is not underling\ndisagreement of facts (like the survival case) but also lay bare what is at stake in\nproposals to reform or change such concepts. the idea unifies puzzles about phenomenal\nconcepts, crypto-evaluative terms, and hate speech. it might explain what is\nat issue between people who are arguing about crypto-evaluative terms (and perhaps\nother thick moral terms) and thus when the different participants can or should\nrevise their usage. it provides a tempting explanation of how hate-concepts might be\nassociated with hate speech, and how such concepts differ from merely descriptive\nones associated with inflammatory words. it is suggestive of mechanisms where bias\ncan be purely implicit, and inaccessible to an agent honestly interrogating her beliefs\nand desires. it is equally suggestive of how it might be that linguistic intervention can\ngenerate better consequences than just hiding people’s racist or otherwise biased\nattitudes. one way in which this is a very different approach to, say, haslanger’s\n(2000) view is for her it’s much more important what the ‘input’ conditions are: what\nit takes descriptively to fall under a concept. reasons for linguistic intervention in the\nconcepts we have will fall on the side of the social consequences of categorization.\ni add to this the consequences for the concept possessor; in what possessing such a\nconcept makes one do over and above categorization.\nall of this requires that we really have such mental states, but the explanatory\nmerits of it seem to highlight the importance of the empirical project of determining\nwhether we do. but this chapter has at least done some of the groundwork in ruling\nout two tempting a priori objections: that r-concepts function in such an odd way\nthat even if things a bit like them exist, they don’t do any of the work that would\njustify seeing them as a kind of concept, and that they require use to possess besires.\n\n'], [99, '99\n\n \n \n  '], [100, '100\n5\nstrategic conceptual engineering\nfor epistemic and social aims\ningo brigandt and esther rosario\nconceptual analysis, as traditionally practiced by philosophers, consists in articulating\na concept by means of imagining various scenarios and using one’s intuition as\nto whether or not the concept (e.g., the concept           or the concept\n         ) applies to a given case (jackson 1998; brigandt 2011). this approach\nmakes explicit the concept one currently happens to possess. in contrast, the project\nof conceptual engineering attempts to put forward the most suitable concept for a\nphilosophical task, which may well require revising or abandoning one’s current\nconcepts. kevin scharp (2013) champions this approach when arguing that the\nconcept of       is inconsistent and theoretically unsuitable and that it should be\nreplaced with several successor concepts. in what follows we primarily use the label\n‘conceptual engineering’ for this general approach, although another option is to\nemploy the term conceptual ethics, as advocated by alexis burgess and david\nplunkett (2013a,b), given that the latter label highlights normative questions, such\nas what makes one concept better than another one, which concepts should be used,\nand which concepts should be discarded (see also plunkett and sundell 2013;\nplunkett 2015, 2016). a prominent illustration of this philosophical practice is the\nprior work by sally haslanger (2000, 2004, 2005, 2006) on the concepts        and\n    . her “ameliorative analysis” of gender and race, with definitions that incorporate\nthe hierarchical social treatment of different genders and races, deliberately\ndeviates from standard definitions (even philosophical ones), so as to provide new\nconcepts meant to serve feminist and anti-racist aims.\nwe contribute to discussions on how to construe        and     , where our\nreflections on these concrete cases will also provide guidelines for the general\nphilosophical project of conceptual engineering. in this essay, we put forward various\nsuggestions without endeavouring to articulate a specific concept of        or     .\nin fact, our general position will be that there is no unique, privileged concept of\neither        or     .¹ rather than an alleged all-purpose concept, what is needed\nis a plurality of concepts of        and     , each of which is geared toward certain\n¹ in addition to jennifer saul’s (2006, 2012) proposals, which we will encounter below, there have been\nother discussions attempting to put forward a uniquely correct concept of gender (stone 2004; bach 2012).\n \n \n \n  '], [101, '101\nepistemic and/or social aims. we dub the development of a concept for a specific\nthought and action context—combined with an openness to employing another\nconcept when pursuing other aims—strategic conceptual engineering. we will illustrate\nthis approach by sketching three distinct concepts of       , all of which are\nneeded because each serves a different social aim.\nby ‘concepts’ in general we mean components of a person’s thought which can\ninfluence reasoning as well as action. concepts have the latter capacity by means of\nembodying descriptive and/or normative beliefs (some of which may be implicit).\nthis is not a purely externalist construal of concepts, that would locate all aspects of\nconceptual content outside of a person’s cognitive life. our reason for including and\nin fact focusing on narrow conceptual content is methodological (for a more detailed\naccount, see brigandt 2011). the project of conceptual engineering consists in\nadjudicating why adopting and using one concept is most conducive (or in any\ncase more conducive than another one concept) for conducting a given intellectual or\npractical task. for this philosophical project, aspects of content that impact thought\nor action (such as descriptive or normative beliefs) have to be invoked, so that one is\nin a position to count a person’s adoption of a novel concept or a modification to a\nconcept as a change—and possibly an improvement—in their intellectual or practical\ncapabilities. (the same holds for the study of scientific concepts addressed in the next\nsection.) a purely externalist approach, in contrast, might acknowledge that a\nperson’s beliefs have changed, while maintaining that the concept (e.g., the externally\nestablished referent) has not. but then such an approach would use the notion of\n‘concept’ such that it fails to actively address what is actually relevant for the purpose\nof conceptual engineering and conceptual ethics.²\nbefore turning to conceptual engineering in the concrete context of        and\n     as concepts that have exercised philosophers, we begin with a look at scientific\nconcepts.\nlessons from scientific concepts\nnot only concepts used by philosophers are in need of improvement (as the agenda\nof conceptual engineering underscores), but also scientific concepts are routinely\nrevised. indeed, the investigation of concept change and semantic variation in\nbiology that has been conducted by one of us (brigandt 2010, 2011, 2012) can\nprovide guidance for the philosophical project of conceptual engineering and conceptual\nethics. the motivation for attempting to understand concept change in\nscience is the following.\nscientists are never hostage to the definitions they once used, and upon the arrival\nof a novel theoretical perspective they may redefine a term. for example, with the\nadvent of molecular genetics the                concept gave rise to the significantly\ndifferent                concept (brigandt 2010). the          concept\n(referring to the corresponding structures in different species) was introduced well\n² our motivation for not using a purely externalist construal of concepts can be seen as an instance of\nconceptual engineering pertaining to the philosophical concept        , as it adopts a certain notion of\n        because it is more fruitful for the philosophical task at hand (brigandt 2011).\n \n                                                        \n \n \n  '], [102, '102\nbefore the advent of darwin’s evolutionary theory, and only later came to be given a\ndefinition that appeals to common ancestry (brigandt 2012). yet kuhn (1962) and\nfeyerabend (1962) prominently claimed that a term being used within different\ntheoretical frameworks amounts to ‘incommensurable’ concepts. outside of philosophy\nof science, some have likewise deemed the changing of a term’s definition as\nillegitimate by framing it as a “change of subject” (see also prinzing 2018). for\ninstance, in their argument against a naturalistic reduction of consciousness,\nchalmers and jackson (2001) acknowledge that future neuroscientists may put\nforward what these scientists would call a naturalistic concept of              .\nbut chalmers and jackson insist that this different concept would be irrelevant to\ntheir claims about consciousness involving the current concept of consciousness,\nwhere they do not allow for there being good reasons to replace the concept with a\nrevised one (brigandt 2013).\nthus, the question is how it can in fact be legitimate for scientists to revise a\nconcept. we do not have a clear answer to the notoriously difficult question of how to\nindividuate concepts. but this does not matter for our purposes, because regardless of\nwhether a change is framed as an enduring concept being modified (in features not\naffecting its identity) or as one concept being replaced by a different concept\nassociated with the same term (see also richard, chapter 17, this volume), the project\nis to understand why the new concept is the better one to use. to do so, the crucial\nmove is to view a concept as being used by scientists to pursue a specific scientific aim,\nbecause this aim—brigandt (2010) dubs it the ‘epistemic goal’ of a concept—sets the\nstandards for whether one definition of a concept is superior to another definition. in\nline with the aims that individual scientists pursue, such an epistemic aim is not a\nglobal aim of science (e.g., putting forward explanations), but a local aim that is\npursued by only some scientists in a certain context, for example, explaining programmed\ncell death, or having the ability to experimentally manipulate molecular\npathways involved in cell-cell signalling.\nthe novel philosophical claim is to point out that there are cases where a scientific\naim can be tied to an individual concept in that this concept is being used by scientists\nto pursue this aim. for example, while the                concept was used for the\npurpose of predicting (and statistically explaining) phenotypic patterns of inheritance\nacross generations, the                concept serves the aim of causalmechanistically\nexplaining how inside a cell a gene leads to the formation of its\nmolecular product. making explicit such an aim tied to a concept’s use permits one to\naccount philosophically for the rationality of concept change: a revised definition is\nan improvement over an earlier definition if the former is empirically more conducive\nto meeting this aim (brigandt 2010).³ while concepts are typically construed as\nbeliefs about the concept’s referent and philosophy of science has traditionally\narticulated various representations of natural phenomena, the inclusion of scientists’\ninvestigative, classificatory, or explanatory aims to one’s philosophical study of\n³ while this account was developed independently of work outside of philosophy of science (and more\nexplicitly emphasizes the philosophical role of aims), it aligns with haslanger’s ameliorative project about\nphilosophical concepts: “on my view, whether or not an analysis is an improvement on existing meanings\nwill depend on the purposes of the inquiry” (haslanger 2005: 24, emphasis added).\n \n                                    \n \n \n  '], [103, '103\nscientific concept use adds an additional dimension, as aims are values pertaining to\nwhat human practice is to achieve.\nin addition to diachronic conceptual differences (e.g., concept change in the\nhistory of science), another common situation is synchronic semantic variation\nacross different scientists. the latter can likewise be captured by a philosophical\nframework emphasizing the notion of epistemic aims (which also provides guidelines\nfor philosophical studies of concepts outside of science). for example, genes do not\nform a unique structural kind, resulting in a plethora of different (although overlapping)\ncontemporary uses of the term ‘gene,’ where even one and the same biologist\ncan use the concept differently in different contexts. such semantic variation can be\nphilosophically understood and seen to be conducive to scientific practice in case\ndistinct uses of a term serve somewhat different scientific aims. in the case of the\n               concept as used currently, one can make the case that there is still\none generic epistemic aim shared across all uses of the term, while individual uses\nmay differ in the specific epistemic aim pursued by a person in this context (brigandt\n2010). another case in point is that biologists use various         concepts, which\ncross-classify organisms. philosophers have argued that a plurality of         concepts\nis needed to serve different scientific purposes (kitcher 1984). the conceptual\ndiversity in biology suggests a first lesson for the philosophical project of conceptual\nengineering. it may well be that one definition cannot serve all the legitimate aims\nassociated with a philosophical notion, so that philosophers should be open to a\npluralism that permits different concepts, each of which is most conducive in some\ncontext (see also burgess and plunkett 2013b).\napart from philosophers accounting for conceptual differences in biology in terms\nof scientific aims, there are cases where the scientists themselves are aware of the fact\nthat their semantic differences are due to a concept being used for different purposes\nby different approaches or different biological fields—the diversification of the\n         concept during the last three decades is a case in point (wagner 1989;\nroth 1991; see also brigandt 2003). but in general, the aims for which scientific\nconcepts are used and reshaped are only implicit in scientific practice, which also\nresults in instances of biologists talking past each other when being oblivious of the\nfact that their semantic disagreement is due to individually legitimate, yet different\nscientific aims being at stake. this yields another lesson for conceptual engineering. it\ncan be beneficial to explicitly articulate the aim that a philosophical concept is to\nserve, in particular if others implicitly use the same term for quite different purposes.\nsubsequently showing that one’s proposed concept serves this purpose better than\ntraditional alternatives is no easy task, given that a concept may be meant to serve\nseveral related aims, but being explicit about the aims at stake is a fruitful first step.\nphilosophy of science accounts of concept change have appealed to epistemic aims\nand values, rather than social aims and values. but this should not be construed as an\nendorsement of a dichotomy between epistemic aims and social aims. indeed, even\nthough some do construe ‘epistemic’ narrowly as only those features pertaining to\ntruth (douglas 2009), the above examples of epistemic aims included explanatory\naims—which go beyond aiming at truth given that not every true scientific representation\nis explanatory of a phenomenon and given that causal and mechanistic\nexplanation is also related to the practical ability of effectively intervening in nature.\n \n                                                        \n \n \n  '], [104, '104\nmore generally, the specific aims pursued by scientists typically combine more\nepistemic and more practical considerations, from pragmatic constraints on research\n(e.g., not pursuing a question that one cannot answer given data and computational\nlimitations) to intended applications that implicate pharmaceutical or environmental\naims (kitcher 2001). this entwinement of the epistemic and the social also holds for\nscientific concepts and categories, which can implicitly embody non-epistemic values,\nor at least their use can be criticized based on such values (brigandt 2015). that\nsaid, many general discussions of scientific concepts have tended to focus on more\nepistemic aims, so it is now time to turn to concepts that explicitly serve socialpolitical\naims.\nengineering concepts in the context of biosocial\nphenomena: gender and race\namong the concepts that answer not only to empirical facts and epistemic aims but\nalso to social-political aims, our discussion focuses on        and     . we do not\nsomuch endeavour to put forward a clearly articulated concept of        or of     \n(and later on will also argue that a plurality of        and      concepts is needed).\ninstead, our primary agenda is to offer methodological remarks on how to engineer\nthese concepts, with implications for other concepts relevant to philosophers\nengaging in conceptual engineering and conceptual ethics. before also addressing\nthe notion of     , we begin with       .\nsally haslanger (2000)—while explicitly acknowledging that there may be further\nconcepts of       —prominently put forward the following definition of      \n(we do not restate her analogous definition of    ):\ns is a woman iff\n(i) s is regularly and for the most part observed or imagined to have certain bodily\nfeatures presumed to be evidence of a female’s biological role in reproduction;\n(ii) that s has these features marks s within the dominant ideology of s’s society\nas someone who ought to occupy certain kinds of social position that are in fact\nsubordinate (and so motivates and justifies s’s occupying such a position); and\n(iii) the fact that s satisfies (i) and (ii) plays a role in s’s systematic subordination,\nthat is, along some dimension, s’s social position is oppressive, and s’s satisfying (i)\nand (ii) plays a role in that dimension of subordination. (haslanger 2000: 42)\none motivation for this definition is prior scepticism about the possibility of putting\nforward a coherent concept of       . s   and        have traditionally been\ndistinguished, with sex pertaining to biological features, while gender roughly being\nthe social meaning of sex. but it has been questioned whether sex is independent of\nsocial construction (butler 1990, 1993). and the idea of gender being constituted by\ncertain social features may commit one to postulating a sort of social essence of\ngender, which is unacceptable given that different women can face different social\nexpectations, occupy different social positions, and can have radically different social\nexperiences (as shown vividly by considerations about intersectionality). by falsely\nmaintaining that all women share certain social properties, any definition of ‘woman’\n \n                                    \n \n \n  '], [105, '105\nwould effectively privilege certain forms of femininity while excluding others. this\ncasts doubt on whether it is advisable for a feminist to ever put forward a specific\ndefinition of ‘woman,’ yet at the same time it is unclear who the target of feminist\nactivism is if it does not pertain to women, as a socially construed category (alcoff\n1988; heyes 2000; stone 2004).\nby not assuming that women must have a unique, shared psychological identity or\nidentical social experiences, haslanger’s above account circumvents these problems\nand instead focuses on the point that, because of their gender, women tend to occupy\ndisadvantaged social positions. this provides not only an idea that can unite feminist\nactivists, it more generally is a concept that is geared toward addressing legitimate social\naims. haslanger’s concept of        and her proposed concept of      (which\nlikewise highlights discrimination and differential social privilege) are meant to be\n“effective tools in the fight against injustice,” and their development was guided by\nthe “need to identify and explain persistent patterns of inequalities between females and\nmales, and between people of different ‘colors’” (haslanger 2000: 36).\nat the same time, haslanger’s account has been criticized for maintaining that\nwomen are by definition those female persons who are subordinated. jennifer saul\n(2006), responding to haslanger (2006) and her earlier writings, charges that\nhaslanger’s account is not even acceptable to feminists as one of her primary target\naudiences (see also mikkola 2009). haslanger favours a society where there are no\nsubordinated women, that is, no women as defined by her. she thus is seen to commit\nherself to the social goal of the “elimination of women,” a goal when stated in these\nterms “may well alienate many of those who would be most likely to support antioppression\nmovements” (saul 2006: 139). saul’s central worry is that using a term like\n‘woman’ with a meaning that departs from standard usage is bound to create confusion.\nconsequently, in this early commentary, saul (2006) prefers to use ‘woman’ and ‘man’\nas denoting biological sex (in line with what she considers ordinary use and devoid of\nsocial factors like subordination), indicating that she does not think that ordinary\nspeakers even use ‘gender’ as a social category that is distinct from ‘sex.’\nto our minds, saul’s perspective has problems, a discussion of which offers lessons\nfor the project of conceptual engineering beyond the case of gender. first, saul’s\ncriticism of haslanger focuses on terminology, on how to linguistically use a given\nterm, and on communication across speakers (and the same holds for mari mikkola’s\n2009 objections to haslanger). this ignores the question of what concepts to use,\nwhere concepts are vehicles of thought—broadly understood as also motivating\naction—that can be employed by an individual regardless of communication by\nmeans of language. the issue is what overall set of concepts are needed within a\nlarger community of agents (given their diverse legitimate aims), and by implication,\nwhat novel concepts may have to be developed. in their proposal of the project of\nconceptual ethics, burgess and plunkett (2013a) rightly assume that questions about\nwhat concepts to employ and questions about what terms to use to express them\nlinguistically are separate issues.4 this is also something that haslanger recognized:\n4 “that we ought to use concept c does not yet settle how we should lexicalize it, for example” (burgess\nand plunkett 2013a: 1095).\n \n                                                        \n \n \n  '], [106, '106\nat this point we should bracket the terminological issues and just consider whether the groups\nin question are the ones that are important to consider given the goals of our inquiry.\n(haslanger 2000: 46–7)\nin our view, considerations about concepts are vital—even when the issue of\nterminology is disregarded—given that “our conceptual repertoire determines not\nonly what we can think and say but also, as a result, what we can do and who we can\nbe” (burgess and plunkett 2013a: 1091). indeed, as the previous section on scientific\nconcepts has hinted at, a concept is meant for certain intellectual or practical\npurposes and thus to be used in some contexts only. a community and even one\nperson can fruitfully employ a variety of different concepts depending on the context.\nthis makes room for the possibility that haslanger’s novel (or some similar) concept\nof        is fruitful, at least when the identification and explanation of gender-based\ndiscrimination is at stake, even if other cognitive contexts require different concepts\nof       .5 consequently, our recommendation is to first address questions about\nwhat concepts are fruitful, and only then to discuss the (admittedly difficult) question\nof what terms to use to express them, for example, whether a newly engineered\nconcept should be associated with an existing term, to which another concept is\nalready tied, or whether to introduce a new term for this novel concept (see also\nmcpherson and plunkett, chapter 14, this volume). (we will comment in the\nconcluding section on what terminology may be best for public discourse despite\nour pluralistic approach to        concepts.)\nsecond, even when side-stepping the domain of concepts and moving on to\nconsiderations about communication, while saul is rightly worried about the possibility\nof misunderstandings, this may lead to a problematic preference for sticking to\nthe common use of terms:\nit seems to me that communication is difficult enough as it is, and that we should instead try to\nuse ordinary terms in as ordinary a way as possible. (saul 2006: 141)\nalthough there are serious questions about how one can realistically effect a widespread\nchange of common term use and when it is wise to attempt this, saul’s bias\ntoward the status quo may be particularly precarious for ordinary terms, given that in\nsome cases such term uses are highly problematic and should be reformed, for\nexample, the past practice to use ‘rape’ so as to not consider marital rape as such.\nin the context of concepts, such a bias is at odds with the very spirit of conceptual\nengineering and conceptual ethics, which endeavours not only to introduce completely\nnovel concepts, but also to abandon or transform existing concepts to the\nextent to which they are empirically flawed or unsuited for their intended purpose\n(for other reasons to discard a folk concept, see mcpherson and plunkett, chapter 14,\nthis volume).\n5 although saul (2006) acknowledges the possibility of using the term ‘woman’ with different meanings\nin different contexts, she rejects this option on grounds of misunderstanding in communication across\ncontexts, and thereby fails to evaluate whether using haslanger’s concept can be fruitful in some contexts of\na person’s thought and action.\n \n                                    \n \n \n  '], [107, '107\nwe will get to the issue of concepts of        and      embodying problematic\nempirical assumptions soon, but first we address the political purpose for which\nhaslanger puts forward her ameliorative analysis. saul does have this issue in view,\nand argues that even with her preferred option of using ‘woman’ and ‘man’ as\ndenoting biological sex (and thus as synonymous to ‘female’ and ‘male,’ respectively),\na social explanation of inequalities is possible:\nthe explanation of persistent inequalities between females and males would begin from the\nfact that females tend to be systematically subordinated to males. the next step would be to\nanalyse this systematic subordination and how it is perpetuated. (saul 2006: 136)\nhowever, saul’s approach construes gender as a purely biological category and views\npointing to the social factors underlying gender-based discrimination as a second\nstep and thus as a separate issue.6 in contrast, haslanger’s concept of        rightly\nhighlights that despite the biological aspects of gender, a proper understanding of the\nmatter has to explicitly include that the gender differences at hand are due to social\nfactors. there are many biosocial kinds that combine a mutual causal influence of\nmore biological and more social factors. and if the purpose of a concept referring to\nsuch a kind is to be explanatory, a properly engineered concept has to include in its\ncontent all the relevant causal factors and how they are entwined.7 thus, for the\npurpose of accounting for inequalities across the sexes, haslanger’s concept of\n       is superior to the concept     or a biological concept of        as the\none preferred by saul (2006), even if saul can in fact provide the social explanation by\nadducing additional (non-biological) concepts.\na case where not only the entwinement of more biological and more social factors\nmatters to social-political aims, but where ordinary concepts can also embody\nproblematic empirical assumptions, is race. historical and some current conceptions\nof      assume racialism, in particular the idea that there are behavioural and\ncognitive differences between human races and that these are due to biological\ndifferences. given that this is empirically false, appiah (1996) has prominently\nargued that there are no races—because there is nothing in reality corresponding\nto this ordinary concept of      (see also zack 1993). others have instead opted for\nusing a different concept of      that discards false beliefs, for example, one that\nfocuses on the cultural construction of race. as mallon (2006) points out, the\nphilosophers endorsing eliminativism, constructivism, and other rival positions on\n6 mikkola (2009: 581) says something similar: “there is nothing in my proposal that prevents feminists\nfrom identifying and explaining persistent inequalities since this is a separate empirical task.” however, she\nnever explains what this empirical task is separate from—certainly it is not separate from haslanger’s\nagenda of providing a concept of ‘woman’ that identifies and explains persistent inequalities.\n7 in the introduction we justified in general terms why a strongly externalist construal of concepts does\nnot work for our agenda, and instead concepts have to be construed as embodying relevant empirical (or\nnormative) beliefs. yet a much deeper failure to appreciate that conceptual engineering is not the\nacquisition of novel empirical knowledge by means of analysing current concepts, but the incorporation\nof relevant content into a concept using previously acquired empirical knowledge, can be found in mikkola\n(2009: 580): “i am unconvinced that politically much, if anything, hangs on analysing [sic!] the concept\nwoman. in fact, to claim that by discerning the conditions for satisfying woman the content of feminist\npolicies is discovered, strikes me as extremely implausible.”\n \n                                                        \n \n \n  '], [108, '108\nrace actually agree on the basic empirical facts, and the preference for different\npositions hinges on normative considerations (see also ludwig 2014).\ngiven our focus on the conceptual engineering aim of capturing race-based\ndiscrimination, what we want to highlight is the insight of kaplan (2010) that even\nif there are biological differences among races in a country, these may well be due to\nsocial factors (see also kitcher 2007: 315). his starting point is the partial success of\nrace-based medicine, for example, the drug bidil recommended as a treatment to\nprevent heart failure in african americans. this suggests the existence of medical\nand thus biological differences across some races, given that differential drug efficacy\npresupposes different physiological features in different individuals. yet kaplan\nargues that even if there are such differences, this does not entail that they are due\nto alleged genetic differences across races (as shown by the different health of african\namericans and recent immigrants from africa). instead, in a context like the us, the\nphysiological and health differences may very well be due to social discrimination,\nwhich affects diet, exposure to pollutants and toxins, and levels of stress experienced\n(a risk factor for hypertension and heart disease). a further point of his is that the\nlabel ‘race-based medicine’ erroneously suggests that this is to be dealt with as a\nmedical (rather than primarily social) problem. but what matters most for our\npurposes is that the example of race reveals that some philosophical concepts that\naim at explaining social differences (or at exposing social discrimination) have to\ncapture the reciprocal influence of social and biological features.\na common motivation for overlooking the connection between the social and the\nbiological is the spectre of biological determinism. some discussions of sex and\ngender are also predicated on a nature-nurture dichotomy. the latter assumes that\nas one layer there is nature, which is unaffected by how nurture builds on it as a\nsecond layer. the dichotomy between the two alleged layers also takes for granted\nthat it is meaningful to claim either that nature constrains nurture or that nurture is\nlargely unconstrained by nature. the nature-nurture dichotomy, however, is empirically\nfalse, and many biologists have abandoned it on the more profound ground\nthat it is a conceptually flawed and theoretically useless perspective (and instead have\ncome to emphasize the idea of phenotypic plasticity and other notions capturing the\nentwinement of organismal development and environment; pigliucci 2001).\nhow to promote concepts that avoid false empirical beliefs (such as a naturenurture\ndichotomy or biological determinism) among the general public is a difficult\nmatter. indeed, when anthropologists use the term ‘race’ at all, they usually use it in\nthe context of cultural identification, as they are rightly worried that using ‘race’ in\nconnection with biological (or at least genetic) features will trigger illicit connotations.\nnevertheless, the lesson for the philosophical project of conceptual engineering\nis more obvious. gannett (2010) points out that even discussions of race by philosophers\nhave tended to be conducted in terms of social constructivism vs. biological\nrealism (and a separation of the conceptual schemes of experts and laypersons), so as\nto result in a problematic “dichotomization of the biological and the social” (p. 368).\nwhile there are legitimate concepts of      that focus on cultural factors, our\ndiscussion about biomedical differences across races being due to social discrimination\nshows the need for some concept of      that captures in an empirically\nadequate fashion how social and biological factors are in reality interrelated. the\n \n                                    \n \n \n  '], [109, '109\nbeliefs about race currently held across the general public of course fail to reflect this\nemerging empirical account, but the fact that ordinary beliefs are not excluded from\nbeing empirically flawed and potentially harmful—and may even be particularly\nprone to be so, as racialist conceptions of race show—underscores yet again the\nproblem with saul’s (2006) recommendation of trying to use concepts with their\nordinary meanings.8\ngender and the inclusion of trans persons\nbeyond the worry that a revised concept of        like haslanger’s departs from\nordinary use (which above we found not to be compelling), there are important issues\nto be addressed. for recent discussions of gender have emphasized the need to ensure\nthat the concept       include trans women (bettcher 2013, 2017a; kapusta\n2016)). this is not only a problem for haslanger’s account (as we will address\nbelow), but jennifer saul likewise recognizes that her earlier approach (in saul\n2006) failed to include trans women because it favoured using ‘woman’ to denote\nthose persons who are biologically female.  now saul (2012) favours a contextualist\napproach, which (in addition to an analogous definition of    ) construes the\nconcept       as follows:\nx is a woman is true in a context c iff x is human and relevantly similar (according to the\nstandards at work in c) to most of those possessing all of the biological markers of female sex.\n(saul 2012: 201)\nin some contexts, the standards may indeed entail that the relevant similarity\npertains to biological sex, but saul discusses other similarity conditions. in this\nfashion, she can capture persons with intersex conditions as well as trans persons,\nwhere the latter fall under the gender category which with they identify.\nat the same time, saul has some misgivings about this contextualist approach, on\nthe grounds that it is too flexible and may permit using       with any meaning.\nfor instance, there are situations where biological and other similarity conditions are\noperative according to which trans women are not women. given this, saul worries\nthat this makes a trans woman’s assertion that she is a woman true only in the specific\ncontext in which she makes this utterance, and thus true in an utterly trivial fashion\n(as opposed to it being a substantial, context-independent truth about this women’s\ngender in line with her self-perception). the flipside of this issue is that also the\n8 another instance of concepts embodying empirically flawed assumptions (regardless of whether this\nalways aligns with ordinary meanings) is saul’s suggestion to use ‘woman’ and ‘man’ as denoting biological\nsex. this assumes that these are the only biological categories and that there is a unique account of\nbiological sex. yet the diverse human conditions collectively called ‘intersex conditions’ shows not only\nthat sex is not a binary category (and instead a spectrum), but also that sex-related biological features such\nas genes, chromosomes, hormones, internal/external sex organs, and secondary sex characteristics do not\nalways align, where even one person can possess chromosomally male and female cells (ainsworth 2015;\nsee also kessler 1990; butler 1993).\n  while we previously objected to saul’s (2006) desideratum to use terms with their established,\nordinary meanings, we also do not think that ordinary use would support saul’s earlier, exclusively\nbiological construal of      , given that laypersons’ actual use is more diverse and flexible, which\noften includes trans women.\n \n                                                        \n \n \n  '], [110, '110\nstatements of those lawmakers who claim trans women to not be women (and who\npass laws that prohibit trans women from using women’s washrooms) seem to come\nout as true. saul’s worry is that one may have to grant that in these lawmakers’ context\nthe standards are such that their biological construal of       obtains.\nsaul sees the option of insisting that her own standards, rather than those of\ntransphobic lawmakers, are the right ones. yet she frames this approach as follows:\non my view of “woman,” i cannot argue that the lawmakers are making a mistake about how\nthe word “woman” works. but what i can do is argue that they are morally and politically\nwrong to apply the standards that they do. . . . but we must recognize this claim for what it is: a\nmoral and political, rather than merely linguistic, claim. (saul 2012: 204)\nsaul correctly recognizes that moral and political considerations are involved; however,\nshe seems to view them as separate from and something over and above\nlanguage use. a dichotomy between concept use and moral-political values should\nnot only be alien to philosophers engaged in the project of conceptual ethics (see also\nplunkett 2015; díaz-león, chapter 9, this volume; mcpherson and plunkett,\nchapter 14, this volume). as we have explained above, also scientists revise their\nlanguage use and disagree on how to use a scientific term in part because of the values\nand scientific aims they favour, which can include environmental, applicationrelated,\nand other practical aims. furthermore, there is the widespread phenomenon\nof ordinary discourse where a disagreement is not about the object being talked about,\nbut about what concept should be used to describe the object. this negotiation about\nwhat particular concept (e.g., what construal of      ) to use in a certain context has\nbeen dubbed ‘metalinguistic negotiation’ by david plunkett and tim sundell (2013);\nand they argue that metalinguistic disagreements can be substantial disagreements\n(as among other things they influence action, e.g., whether to add more spice).¹°\nmetalinguistic negotiation is linguistic (or about how a certain word works, as saul\nputs it), but at the same time based on aesthetic, moral, or political values.\nin her response to saul’s discussion, esa díaz-león (2016) rightly argues that\nopting for the employment of moral and political considerations regarding the use of\n‘woman’ can also be seen “as a genuinely linguistic point” (p. 248). the standards of\nsimilarity that are at work in a given context matter for saul’s contextualism, yet\n“questions about the relevant standards might involve moral and political considerations\n(and in cases that concern the rights of trans women, will very likely do so)”\n(díaz-león 2016: 249). díaz-león points to the distinction between attributor factors\nand subject factors that has been invoked in epistemic contextualism. in a situation\nwhere person a wonders whether or not subject s counts as knowing that p,\nattributor contextualism maintains that this is contingent on the context of knowledge\nattributor a, that is, attributor factors determine the standards. in contrast,\nsome have objected that instead it better be subject factors (the context of putative\n¹° in the ‘lessons from scientific concepts’ section we critically mentioned chalmers and jackson’s\n(2001) tenet that it is illicit to associate a term with a different concept (a situation which they frame as a\n“change of subject”). yet such metalinguistic negotiation can very well be legitimate; in fact, the target of\nplunkett and sundell’s (2013) criticism is the idea that meaningful disagreement always presupposes that\ntwo speakers use the same concept (and make different claims with it).\n \n                                    \n \n \n  '], [111, '111\nknower s) that are relevant for setting the standards of knowledge. díaz-león\nsuggests that the latter option—subject contextualism—should be used for the\nconcept      , in which case it is not the lawmakers’ context (or the context of\nanyone else who may make claims as to whether a trans woman as a woman) that\nmatters, but the trans woman’s context:\naccording to subject-contextualism about woman, “x is a woman” is true iff x is human and\nrelevantly similar to most females, where what counts as relevantly similar to most females\ndepends on “objective” features of x’s context, including instrumental, moral, and political\nconsiderations having to do with how x should be treated (regardless of who utters the\nsentence or what their beliefs are). (díaz-león 2016: 251)\ndíaz-león’s approach strikes us as basically correct, though we add in way of\nclarification that when person a uses a concept that refers to another person s, it\ncannot always be the case (or be an a priori matter) that it is the latter person’s\ncontext that is the relevant one. and to the extent that s’s context matters, it need not\nbe her beliefs or values that settle the issue. for instance, a trans woman may happen\nto have a conception of       that diverges from the conception of other trans\nwomen (and other women in general) and an adoption of which would be morally\nand politically problematic in the given situation. instead, in the case at hand\n(positions taken by lawmakers about trans women), what is at stake is whether\ntrans women are treated equally to other women—an issue that also follows from\nthe context of a transphobic lawmaker (the attributor context). regarding the\nquestion of equal treatment, the proper social-political aim is that trans women are\naccorded the same rights as other women (regardless of whether given their personal\nvalues some lawmakers or trans women may disagree). thus, the lesson is that the\nphilosophical focus should be on the relevant and legitimate aims (which may not\nbe the aims of either the attributor or the subject of an utterance), which must be\nidentified and have to be justified as legitimate (even if they already happen to\nbe agreed upon). we shall use this advice in the remainder of the section, in which\nwe also highlight that a particular concept       has to be geared to a specific aim.\nthe desideratum that trans persons ought to be fully included by a philosophical\naccount of gender has recently been reiterated by katharine jenkins (2016). her\ncritical target is haslanger’s earlier ameliorative concept      , and jenkins argues\nthat it excludes trans women by counting many trans women as men. the definition\nby haslanger requires of a woman that the person be “regularly and for the most part\nobserved or imagined to have certain bodily features presumed to be evidence of a\nfemale’s biological role in reproduction” (haslanger 2000: 42), yet jenkins points to\nseveral cases where some trans women would not fall under this definition: she may\nbe respected as a woman regardless of not being deemed to have a female’s reproductive\nrole, she may not publicly present as a woman, or—particularly\nproblematically—her public gender presentation is not respected by others as being a\nwoman. to remedy this issue, jenkinsmakes the useful distinction between two relevant\nconcepts of       . while the first one,                , is basically haslanger’s\nameliorative concept, jenkins puts forward her account of                   , which\nis to properly include trans persons. in the next section, we will say more on the way in\nwhich both concepts of gender are needed, but now focus on the latter.\n \n                                                        \n \n \n  '], [112, '112\njenkins puts forward the following definition of                    (for the\ncategory of woman):\ns has a female gender identity iff s’s internal ‘map’ is formed to guide someone classed as a\nwoman through the social or material realities that are, in that context, characteristic of women\nas a class. (jenkins 2016: 410)\nalthough jenkins makes the crucial claim that “this definition of gender identity\nentails that all trans women have a female gender identity” (p. 413), in our view this\nentailment claim is highly dubious, given that jenkins articulates her notion of an\n‘internal map’ as follows:\non my definition, having a female gender identity does not necessarily involve having\ninternalized norms of femininity in the sense of accepting them on some level. rather, what\nis important is that one takes those norms to be relevant to oneself; . . . her experience of social\nand material reality includes navigating the norm that women should have hairless legs, even\nthough she is not complying with it. (jenkins 2016: 411)\nbut even taking gender norms relevant to oneself (without necessarily accepting\nthem) is too strong a condition. on jenkins’s account, a trans woman who happens\nto be oblivious of the norm that women should shave their legs is not a woman (and\nthe same holds for cis women who are unaware of this particular norm). and from\nthe perspective of the project of conceptual engineering and conceptual ethics, why\nwould the inclusion of norms like shaving one’s legs be relevant to a trans-inclusive\nconcept       in the first place \nthe problem is not just that with leg-shaving jenkins has used a poor example of a\nrelevant norm. making explicit that this norm is meant for gender identity in\nwestern cultures or even using a different social norm would not help. in our\nview, the whole point of putting forward a concept        that is trans-inclusive\nis the social-political aim that trans women (and also cis women) are socially\naccepted as the gender with which they identify, and have all the moral and legal\nrights corresponding to their gender. one’s (sincere) self-identification as a woman\nshould suffice for this, and one should not make social and legal recognition as a\nwoman contingent on being aware of any gender-related norm, as jenkins does. as\nan analogy, take party membership, for example, being a republican in the us. of\ncourse, republicans tend to have many factual beliefs, political values, and social\npractices in common that form their political identity, and these shared features are\nimportant to sociologists and political scientists for predictive and explanatory\npurposes (predictions and explanations that are useful even if there are some\nrepublicans that do not conform to the stereotype). however, republicans who\nare untypical in terms of their beliefs and values can still be party members and have\nconcomitant rights. for instance, being registered as a republican voter (according to\nstate guidelines) suffices for being eligible to vote in a republican primary—no\nspecific ideological test is required to possess this voting right.\nin the case of gender, the fact that persons of one gender tend to have similar\ninternal maps and are aware that certain social norms and gender-related expectations\napply to them is likewise relevant for explanatory purposes, and is an aspect of\nsocial-psychological gender identity that may indeed be relevant for some concept of\n \n                                    \n \n \n  '], [113, '113\n      . endorsing such social norms is required by a strong ideological test, while\nmerely being aware of the existence of these gender-related norms (as jenkins\nenvisions) can be dubbed a weak ideological test. however, for the purpose of a\nconcept of        (or                ) that has the purpose of guaranteeing\ngender-appropriate social recognition and rights (and that can usefully complement\nhaslanger’s concept of                ), not even a weak ideological test should be\nrequired to count as a woman (or as a man). in addition to the concern of excluding\ntrans women, recent female immigrants from other cultures may not be aware of\nvarious gender-related social expectations (e.g., shaving one’s legs in a western\nculture) and not have them as part of their current internal map, yet this should be\nno grounds to deny them social recognition as women and the rights that other\nwomen have. in summary, for the specific social-political aim of achieving genderappropriate\nrecognition and rights, we advocate using a concept of        that\ndefines someone to be a woman or man solely in terms of this person’s sincere selfidentification\nwith a particular gender, for example, as long as someone identifies as\nbelonging to the gender commonly denoted by the term ‘woman.’¹¹ more precisely,\nin many legal contexts ‘man’ and ‘woman’ are the only two categories, while for the\npurpose of social recognition more than two genders may well be needed—but in this\ncase, the issue is also a person’s mere self-identification with a gender.\nstrategic conceptual engineering\nit is useful to view a concept as a tool that serves certain epistemic, social, and other\naims (brigandt 2011; burgess and plunkett 2013b; prinzing 2018; mcpherson and\nplunkett, chapter 14, this volume). while such aims are sometimes implicit in how a\nconcept is used and how it is revised, for the purpose of deliberate and effective\nconceptual engineering our discussion has repeatedly emphasized the need to articulate\nthe aim at stake and to ensure that a concept employed actually embodies those\nempirical facts that are conducive to this aim. this is admittedly easier said than\ndone. one hurdle is justifying that something is a legitimate aim, and to convince\nothers of its importance. not only were, in the past, social aims deemed to be\nlegitimate that are nowadays repudiated, but disagreement about what the relevant\naims are exist even within contemporary academic subcommunities. while we\ndiscussed several scholars (saul, díaz-león, and jenkins) who endorse the desideratum\nthat a concept of ‘woman’ include trans women, there are unfortunately\nfeminists who oppose this based on a trans-exclusive stance on feminist identity\npolitics (heyes 2006; watson 2016; bettcher 2017b; mckinnon 2018).\nmoreover, it can be difficult to assess whether several related aims better be viewed\nas separate in that they cannot all be fully met by one concept. for instance, when\nputting forward her concept of       , sally haslanger (2000) singles out the need\n¹¹ mckitrick (2007: 141) wonders about a proposal like ours: “perhaps having a female gender identity\nsupervenes on the psychological property of having a strong and persistent belief that you are a woman.\nbut again, that merely pushes back the question: what exactly is it that you believe about yourself ” here\nour analogy with party membership is instructive, where all that is cognitively required is that one identify\nas belonging to a collection of individuals picked out by such a label as ‘republican’ or ‘woman.’\n \n                                                        \n \n \n  '], [114, '114\nto “identify and explain persistent inequalities” (p. 36). but these could be viewed as\ntwo distinct aims, and a concept that merely identifies patterns of discrimination may\nnot embody the relevant psychological and social factors that actually explain these\npatterns. more importantly, beyond description and explanation—which could be\nviewed as largely epistemic aims—haslanger explicitly adopts the social-political aim\nof fighting oppression, by means of providing conceptual “tools in the fight against\ninjustice” (p. 36). but as jennifer saul’s (2006) criticism highlights, if those in\nsubordinated positions rely on a concept that offers a causal explanation of systematic\ndiscrimination (even when it highlights the social nature thereof), this may very\nwell motivate them to “become trapped in a feeling of powerless to change their own\nfates” (p. 138). this raises the difficult question of whether the aim of explaining\ndiscrimination and of opposing discrimination have sometimes—though not\nalways—to be addressed separately when engineering concepts. in addition to\nidentifying and explaining inequalities, haslanger lists the “need for accounts of\ngender and race that take seriously the agency of women and people of color of both\ngenders” (2000: 36), but it is doubtful that her definitions of        and     \nactually capture the relevant agency, so this may be yet another aim that requires a\nseparate treatment. we will return to this difficult issue below by opting to separate\ncertain social aims insofar as quite different concepts of        are needed to\naddress each of them.\nregarding the question of how to construe race, it is clear that a traditional\nbiological conception that would posit significant phenotypic differences between\nraces and take them to be due to genetic differences between races is empirically false\n(rose et al. 2009; hochman 2013; pigliucci 2013; yudell et al. 2016; spencer 2018a).\nmoreover, grouping humans into races is not even a major classificatory or explanatory\naim for contemporary population genetics (templeton 2013; kopec 2014).\na useful concept of race will therefore ensure to include the social factors that\ninfluence how persons come to be deemed to be of a certain race (e.g., persons of\nbiracial ancestry considered to be black), how racial self-identity is generated, how a\nrace is perceived by others, and how persons from different races are treated within\nsociety, so as to track the social dynamics of race. despite the largely cultural nature\nof race—which suffices for many epistemic and social purposes where a concept of\nrace is employed—our discussion has pointed out that biological features enter not\nonly in the trivial sense of skin colour and other phenotypic features being socially\nconceptualized. the way that social discrimination can have actual physiological\neffects that result in predispositions to disease matter if the aim is to offer a thorough\nexplanation of social dynamics, and at least when an explanation of health disparities\nis sought after. a concept of race that highlights social impacts on biological features\nis also conducive to the social aim of reducing discrimination, and of opposing\nerroneous biological determinist conceptions (which have been promoted by the\nidea of race-based medicine).\nto be sure, these race-related health disparities hold for the context of the united\nstates; and philosophical commentators have indicated that race operates differently\nand has another overall prominence in many other countries (alcoff 2006), for\ninstance, when even in biomedical contexts the notion of           is more relevant\n(gannett 2010; ludwig 2014). the best concept of      to employ in some\n \n                                    \n \n \n  '], [115, '115\ncaribbean or south american contexts such as cuba or brazil may well be different\nfrom one geared toward conditions in the us.¹² different societies may not only\nempirically differ in their social processes, but their different identity politics concerns\nmay result in different legitimate aims that a particular concept of race has to\nserve. thus, it appears that there is no unique concept of race that could capture all\ncultural contexts and serve all epistemic and social aims.\nsome may wonder whether a concept that includes all biological and social\nfeatures and distinguishes how they operate in different cultural (or historical)\ncontexts can function as an all-purpose concept after all. we doubt that this is an\noption even for a concept of      (see also hardimon 2017; spencer 2018b). one\nreason is that relative to one explanatory aim, a concept should only include what is\nexplanatorily relevant and thus not adduce any feature (no matter how true) that is\nirrelevant to the phenomenon to be explained. therefore, an explanatory concept\nmust exclude some aspects of reality, which however have to be included with respect\nto some other explanatory aim. in the context of scientific concepts we have already\ncovered that biologists use, for instance, different species concepts because these\nanswer to different concrete biological aims.\nin any case, a strong case against all-purpose concepts can be made in the case of\ngender and political aims. we call not only for a plurality of concepts of       , but\nfor what we dub strategic conceptual engineering, which is the strategic employment\nof a concept for certain epistemic or social aims, combined with the understanding\nthat this concept has a limited scope of application and the openness to use another\nconcept with respect to other aims. in what follows, we distinguish three different\nsocial-political aims, and argue that different concepts of gender are needed to meet\neach aim, respectively.\n(1) identifying and explaining gender-based discrimination. haslanger’s definition\nhas been criticized, where the most noteworthy point has been that it fails to count\ntrans women as women. yet this tension can be resolved if in line with the idea of\nstrategic conceptual engineering one views haslanger’s concept as restricted to\nparticular aims.¹³ at the very least, haslanger’s proposal, which highlights the\noppression of women (due to being women), was calculated to be strategically useful\nwhen she put it forward, given that haslanger reacted to scepticism within the\n¹² for similar reasons, race and gender cannot be treated in a completely analogous fashion (heyes\n2006). the situation that both race and gender are widely held to be social constructions should not\nobscure the fact that they do not socially function in the same way even within the same sociohistorical\ncontext. in north america, gender is often treated by theorists as an individual property of the body or of a\nperson (centering on one’s psychological identity and social experiences), whereas race clearly implicates\nancestry and cultural history. in such contexts, a properly engineered concept of      would do well to\ntake heritage into account (while making room for the possibility of some people adapting a racial\nreception that disavows or ignores a part or parts of their ancestry).\n¹³ when distinguishing the concepts                 and                   , jenkins (2016)\ncharges that haslanger, although acknowledging different concepts of       , still privileges her ameliorative\naccount (i.e.,                ). this strikes us as false, given that haslanger made plain that she\nviews any concept of        as tied to certain purposes: “let me emphasize at the beginning that i do not\nwant to argue that my proposals provide the only acceptable ways to define race or gender; in fact, the\nepistemological framework i employ is explicitly designed to allow for different definitions responding to\ndifferent concerns” (haslanger 2000: 36).\n \n                                                        \n \n \n  '], [116, '116\nfeminist scholarly community about the relevance of even articulating a concept of\n      (alcoff 1988; heyes 2000; stone 2004), by providing a conceptual tool for the\naim of uniting feminist activism. an approach similar to haslanger’s is in our view\nalso fruitful for the aim of identifying gender-based discrimination or of explaining\nthe social workings of this discrimination (so as to indicate how it could be remedied),\nprovided that the following constructive suggestions of ours are being used.\nfirst, while haslanger’s ameliorative definition—and the subsequent criticism—is\nactually about the concept       (and    ), we suggest that (with respect to the\naim of identifying discrimination) the focus should be on the concept       , of\nwhich one can offer a revised, ameliorative definition without also redefining      \nand     (or without establishing any bold entailments about       and    ). an\nadvantage of this is that it shifts the focus away from questions about the extension of\nconcepts, such as the question of whether there are females that are not discriminated\nagainst and thus not women on haslanger’s definition.¹4 sometimes the specific\nextension of a concept does matter—as in the case of a concept of       that\nattributes rights and social recognition to those classified as women (to which we\nturn below). but concepts may have other virtues (e.g., exhibiting discrimination’s\nsystemic nature) than classificatory functions. an account in the present context\nshould be open to the boundaries of different genders being vague, to some persons\nbeing of more than one gender, and to there being more than two genders. an\naccount of        is definitely not committed to any definitive specification of these\nmatters (while substantial expectations may obtain for a proposed definition of the\ntwo terms ‘woman’ and ‘man’), and can even make room for the number of different\ngenders varying across cultural history. beyond the (immediate) aim of identifying\ndiscrimination, our approach would also be advantageous for haslanger’s ultimate aim\nof eliminating such social gender differences, as this agenda is now framed in terms of\nthe elimination of “gender” rather than in terms of the elimination of “women.”\nsecond, we advocate the use of relational accounts of        (and     ), in which\nthe construal of one gender makes reference to other genders or to the properties\nused to characterize other genders (and in which different races are understood in\nrelation to each other). in contrast, the proposals by saul we have mentioned,\nincluding her contextualist definition of       (saul 2012), do not make reference\nto     (and the same holds for jenkins’ 2016 construal of                ). even\nhaslanger’s account of ‘woman’ is not explicitly relational and instead her definition\nof       focuses on intrinsic features of this category. a general drawback of using\nonly intrinsic features is that this way one has a hard time capturing variation within\nany category, and in the case of gender variation is essential because “there is no one\n‘women’s social role’” (saul 2012: 197). a relational account points to the differential\nsocial treatment of genders. it neither has to claim that all women are subordinated—\nas haslanger’s definition problematically does by excluding non-subordinated\n¹4 recognizing that her account of       raises this question, haslanger (2000) is compelled to\nrespond that she “not convinced that there are many cases (if any) of the latter” (females who are not\nsubordinated for being considered female), while also stating that her “analysis is intended to capture a\nmeaningful political category for critical feminist efforts, and non-oppressed females do not fall within that\ncategory” (p. 46).\n \n                                    \n \n \n  '], [117, '117\nfemales—nor does it have to articulate what this allegedly shared social subordination\nconsist of, for example, the “certain kinds of social position” to which haslanger\nappeals in condition (ii) of her definition (which we restated in an earlier section).\ninstead, a relational construal can indicate that compared to men, women tend to be\ndiscriminated against because of their gender.\nin our view, the decisive advantage of a relational approach is its ability to capture\nintersectionality, that is, the way in which several social identities (gender, race, class,\nsexual orientation, trans status, etc.) intersect for a particular person so as to\naggravate or attenuate oppression and privilege (crenshaw 1989, 1991).¹5 when\nfocusing on        rather than       and articulating gender as an axis of\ndiscrimination, this engineered concept flags that gender is only one axis of discrimination,\nand is open to there being many others dimensions of discrimination (and\nother salient features related to social differences) beyond gender, including race and\nsexual orientation.¹6 recall that this concept of        is to answer to the aim of\nidentifying (and possibly explaining) gender-based discrimination, which for empirical\nand political reasons has to comport with intersectionality. a relational account\nof        highlights the organized and systemic nature of gender-based discrimination,\nwithout claiming that every woman is oppressed and that gender is the only\ndimension of discrimination.\n(2) assigning legal rights and ensuring gender-appropriate social recognition. to be\nsure, a relational concept of        fails to delineate exactly which persons are of a\ncertain gender, which is not relevant for the purpose of identifying and explaining\nsociety-wide discrimination, but is indeed indispensable for the aim of ensuring\ngender-based legal rights and social recognition in line with someone’s gender\nidentity. with respect to this aim, a different concept of gender has to be employed,\nthat entails a specific extension of       and other gender categories (and that has\na normative prong by assigning legal rights and social status to these persons).\njenkins (2016) did put forward an account that is meant to ensure that trans\nwomen count as women. however, we have argued that it fails to do so. for by\ninsisting that one needs to be aware of gender-specific social expectations, jenkins’s\ndefinition makes an individual person’s gender contingent on an ideological test\nimposed by the larger culture. this is not only irrelevant but harmful, given that it\nwould not grant gender-based legal rights and social recognition of a person’s chosen\ngender to someone who is unaware of some social expectations. in contrast, for the\naim of ascribing rights and social recognition, in the previous section we proposed a\nconcept of        according to which one’s sincere belief that one is of a particular\ngender suffices. although a woman’s psychological identity includes more substantial\n¹5 haslanger has intersectionality concerns clearly in view, regardless of whether her particular definitions\nof     and       fully comport with this. for instance, jones (2014) questions whether\nindigenous australian men (who are not privileged by any standard) count as     on haslanger’s\ndefinition, thereby also touching upon questions about the extension of concepts such as     and\n      from which we have tried to move away. (a further discussion that is critical of haslanger but\nstill focuses exclusively on the extensions of concepts is mikkola 2009.)\n¹6 although our below concept of       that is to assign rights (and therefore has to include trans\nwomen) is dedicated to trans issues, this does not mean that the present concept of        cannot\nacknowledge trans status as yet a further axis of discrimination that is distinct from gender.\n \n                                                        \n \n \n  '], [118, '118\nbeliefs about what it means to be a woman, the belief that she belongs to the gender\ncategory termed ‘woman’ is all that is required for her to be recognized and treated\naccordingly.\n(3) empowering persons by means of their gender identity. a further social aim we\nhave not discussed yet is empowering groups of persons, for instance women. this\nalso requires a specific, strategic concept of       . our first concept of        (the\nconcept in the spirit of haslanger’s ameliorative account), when not only identifying\nbut also offering a more detailed explanation of the social workings of gender-based\ndiscrimination, may point to public policy means of reducing discrimination within\nan overall society. however, this may not be helpful for empowering individual\nwomen. for this purpose, the best solution may be a concept of        that\nincorporates substantial psychological aspects of gender identity, provided they are\npositive features conducive to personal empowerment (rather than internalized\nharmful stereotypes). such psychological aspects of gender identity were deliberately\nleft out from our second        concept as self-identification with a particular\ngender, so this concept is clearly unsuitable for the purpose of personal empowerment.\na concept serving the aim of an individual’s personal and social empowerment\nneeds to include relevant gender-related psychological resources and social affordances.\na person should be able to pick and choose amongst a variety of (nonbinary)\ngender associated behaviours and activities in order to construct their own\nparticular gender attributes that enable agency. a clear limitation is that the psychological\nand social features relevant to a particular individual do not hold for all\npersons. indeed, discussions on intersectionality have already shown that even\ndifferent persons belonging to one gender (e.g., all who identify as women on the\nsecond gender concept) need different empowerment strategies, so that it is doubtful\nthat the task can be achieved by a single psychological identity concept, no matter\nhow flexible it is. but the employment of different psychological identity concepts by\ndifferent groups of persons is something that our agenda of strategic conceptual\nengineering welcomes.\nconclusion\nin this essay we have put forward the agenda of strategic conceptual engineering,\nwhich in addition to the development of novel concepts consists in the employment\nof a variety of concepts, such as several concepts of     , where each such concept is\ngeared toward a specific epistemic or social aim, while in other contexts the use a\ndifferent concept is more fruitful. we have illustrated this approach by arguing that\nat least three concepts of        are needed, even when only social aims are in view.\nwith respect to the first aim of identifying and explaining gender-based inequities, a\nconcept similar to haslanger’s ameliorative account is needed; although instead of\nfocusing on the extension of       we suggested a relational construal of       \nwhich highlights differential social treatment across genders and thereby points to\ngender as one (though not the only one) axis of discrimination. a second vital aim is\nto assign gender-based legal rights and social recognition in line with one’s chosen\ngender, so that such a concept must be trans-inclusive and offer a clear-cut account of\nthe extension of       and other gender categories. in contrast to jenkins’s\n \n                                    \n \n \n  '], [119, '119\nproposal, we argued that for the purpose of ensuring rights and social recognition,\nawareness of gender-related social norms and other substantial psychological aspects\nof one’s gender identity have to be omitted; and instead, one’s sincere belief to be of a\nparticular gender (e.g., the category labelled ‘woman’) suffices to count as being of\nthat gender. the third social aim is the empowerment of persons by means of their\ngender identity. now a further concept of        is needed, which does include\npsychological features relevant to personal empowerment and awareness of one’s\nsocial resources, where we acknowledged that even relative to this aim different\nconcepts may be needed given that different groups of persons have different social\nexperiences and occupy different social situations and thus may have to use different\nempowerment strategies.\nbeyond the specific case of gender, our strategic conceptual engineering diverges\nfrom other general approaches. in particular, it goes in several respects beyond how\nthe known phenomenon of semantic contextualism is often conceived. first, strategic\nconceptual engineering includes the creation of completely novel concepts and\nmeanings. furthermore, it importantly articulates that the ‘context’ that determines\nwhich meaning to use is specifically the epistemic or social aims at hand. and third,\nwhereas saul’s (2012) contextualism assumes a unified definition of       across\nall contexts (in terms of some similarity to most biological females, where only the\nspecific similarity metric differs across contexts), our three significantly distinct\nconcepts of        make plain that strategic conceptual engineering is open to\ndifferent contexts requiring completely different concepts. as previously mentioned,\nwe do not have a conclusive account of concept individuation (and for our agenda it\nis more important to adjudicate whether a new conceptual variant—regardless of\nwhether it qualifies as a different concept—is an improvement). yet paying attention\nto the aims of concept use (in addition to a contentious similarity of conceptual\ncontent) also contributes to the question of concept individuation: if one but not the\nother concepts of        is in a position to meet a given social-political aim, this is a\nreason to regard these three concepts as relevantly different (at least for this concrete\ncase of conceptual engineering). for instance, our second concept of        was put\nforward precisely because our first one (building on haslanger’s definition) does not\nspecify someone’s particular gender category (and thus this concept would not serve\nthe purpose of being trans-inclusive and assigning gender-based legal rights and\nsocial recognition). conversely, a concept in terms of one’s self-identification with a\ncertain gender category is not in a position to provide a causal explanation of how\ngender functions as one axis of society-wide discrimination.\nour approach has also the potential to enrich philosophical views of concepts in\ngeneral. discussions in the philosophy of mind and language commonly concern the\nrole that conceptual content has for determining the concept’s extension, that is, they\nfocus on a concept’s satisfaction conditions. when reflecting on some criticisms of\nhaslanger’s account (driven by the question of who would fall under      ), we\nhave argued that (in this specific context) such considerations about the extension of\nconcepts are actually a red herring, given that some concepts do not serve the aim of\nclassification (or of assigning rights to a clearly delineated group of individuals), but\nmay serve the aim of causal explanation (e.g., of discrimination within society). thus,\nconcepts should not only be philosophically studied in terms of their extensions and\n \n                                                        \n \n \n  '], [120, '120\nsatisfaction conditions, but also in terms of the way in which the content embodied in\na concept supports explanatory reasoning. even our second concept of       \n(where extensions matter) has not only a descriptive prong that specifies who counts\nas falling under a certain gender category, but also a normative prong that entails\nlegal rights and a commitment to the social acceptance of a person’s gender identity,\nso that this concept can function in moral reasoning (see also reuter 2019).\nthe topic of our discussion was concepts as vehicles of thought which also\nmotivate action. an issue we have not covered is that the promotion of a useful\nconcept among a wider group of individuals (e.g., for political purposes or empowering\nothers) requires that a concept be communicated, which makes it necessary to\nlexicalize it by using some term that expresses this concept. although one option is to\nuse a single term such as ‘gender’ while having its meaning vary across contexts, we\nhave already encountered the worry that this may hamper communication across\npersons. mikkola (2009) objects to haslanger’s ameliorative account of gender on the\ngrounds that its use by feminists would only confuse ordinary speakers. but this\nassumes a strict separation between the language use of “feminists” and “ordinary\nspeakers,”¹7 as if either of these groups was not internally diverse regarding its\nlanguage and concept use. these groups are also overlapping; and in our view, it is\nnot implausible that a person can use our second or third meaning of        (which\ntakes a first-person view and is of benefit to oneself), while also employing the first\nmeaning of        (which partially takes a third-person view and is most fruitful in\nthinking about the situation of various persons of one’s gender), at least in other\ncontexts. generally, common language already permits a good deal of flexibility,\nwhere a word is used with somewhat varying meanings, which need not conflict in\nthe aspects relevant to a communicative situation, or where the context disambiguates\nsufficiently to not hinder discourse.\nto be sure, there are drawbacks with expressing several meanings by means of an\nestablished term, given that associations tied to one (entrenched) meaning may carry\nover to another meaning (mcpherson and plunkett, chapter 14, this volume). yet a\nmore compelling reason than confusion across speakers is political consequences.\ndespite our resolute pluralism on the level of concepts, we acknowledge that on the\nterminological level one meaning of ‘gender’ may often have to prevail in public\ndiscourse (and different words may have to be found for the other meanings).\namong the three purposes that concepts of        may serve, currently the\npolitically most consequential agenda is to ensure legal rights and social recognition,\nas shown by efforts to publicly misgender trans persons, which would have major\npractical consequences not only in the case of successful legal measures to deny\naccess to public facilities such as bathrooms. thus, to the extent to which existing\nterms such as ‘gender’ and ‘woman’ need to be associated with a prioritized meaning,\nit would be our second concept of        as one’s self-identification with a gender\ncategory.\n¹7 “quite simply, if feminists appropriated haslanger’s gender terms, this would create linguistic\nconfusion between them and ordinary speakers . . . achieving this task would be hugely difficult if feminists\nappropriated haslanger’s gender terminology because it complicates communication between them and\nordinary language users” (mikkola 2009: 569).\n \n                                    \n \n \n  '], [121, '121\nnote that even such a more monistic use of the term ‘gender’ diverges from how\nsome persons ordinarily use the term—our self-identification concept of       \ndefinitely is not about someone’s biological sex at birth. generally, the point of\nconceptual engineering and conceptual ethics is to improve some concepts that are\ncurrently used. not only does this make it unavoidable that a term is used with its\ncurrent meaning while some (also) use it with a revised meaning, but the advocacy\nfor a politically more appropriate meaning of a traditional term will always generate\nsocial friction. the widespread use of such a revised meaning has to be seen as a\npolitical ideal, which can only be achieved by a gradual, arduous process.\n\n'], [122, '122\n'], [123, '123\n'], [124, '124\n   '], [125, '125\nnever say ‘never say “never’’’ \nalexis burgess\nwe theorize with the concepts we have, not the ones we hope to have eventually, at\nsome ideal limit of inquiry. that’s true even when it comes to theorizing about our\ncurrent concepts. such theorizing can therefore be reflexive, blending use and\nmention. to take one simple case: a standard semantics for conjunction just uses\nconjunction itself. more to the point of the present volume, this sort of reflexivity\nshows up in normative theorizing about concepts too. for instance, we’ll use logical\nconcepts to reason about which logical concepts we ought to be using.\nnow suppose you and i disagree about whether or not we ought to use some\nparticular concept c, and we want to start arguing about it. a question of method\narises. should we suspend use of c for the duration of our debate ¹ after all, it would\nseem hypocritical of me to use c in the course of arguing that we shouldn’t use\nc. and it seems circular or question-begging for you to use c in arguing that we can\npermissibly use c (or that we must). so perhaps we should just agree at the outset to\navoid using c. but then again, that policy might sound like a significant concession to\nme, the enemy of c. what’s more, whether or not this suspension policy would be\nprejudicial, it might turn out to be quite impracticable, if c is somehow central to our\nconceptual schemes; as concepts of philosophical interest tend to be. there are no\narchimedean points in conceptual ethics. so what exactly are the rules of engagement\nhere \nthis short chapter tries to make some headway on the methodology of conceptual\nethics by offering a qualified defense of “hypocrisy”.²\nfirst some terminology. by an argument in conceptual ethics, i’ll mean an\nargument in the strict formal sense, whose conclusion concerns whether or not we\nshould use some concept c. this is already a stipulative restriction in scope. i’m\nignoring evaluative conclusions, for example, to focus exclusively on deontic modals.\nand i’m not going to say much about arguments that target multiple concepts at\nonce (e.g., all vague concepts, inconsistent concepts, or concepts of race and gender).\nmy spotlight is meant to be flexible in other ways, however. “we” whose use of c is\nat issue could be anyone you please: we folk, we philosophers, we atheists. “should”\n¹ presumably we’ll have to refer to c somehow, or at least quantify over it; but the question is about use,\nnot mention.’\n² for more on the mirror-image issue of circularity, see my (2013).\n \n \n \n  '], [126, '126\ncan also be glossed in different ways: morally, prudentially, rationally; all-thingsconsidered;\nor just pro tanto. and note that conclusions of this basic form can be\ncombined to yield more nuanced views in conceptual ethics. revisionism about c, for\nexample, might be taken to decompose into a pair of views: that we should not use\nc (i.e., eliminativism) but should use c*; where c and c* stand in some suitable\nsimilarity relation.³\ni’ll call an argument that we should not use c an “anti-c” argument, and an\nargument that we can or should use c a “pro-c” argument.4 so a “circular” argument\nin conceptual ethics is a pro-c argument that uses c. and a “hypocritical” argument in\nconceptual ethics is an anti-c argument that uses c.5 when i say that an argument\n“uses” a concept c, i basically mean that a phrase whose content involves c appears in\nsome line of the argument.\nnow, actual anti-c arguments in this area rarely have conclusions as blunt as: one\nshouldn’t use c, period. people rather tend to argue for parameterized conclusions,\nlike: one shouldn’t use c for these sorts of purposes, or in those kinds of contexts.\nelsewhere, david plunkett and i have spilled some ink on the range of relevant\nparameters in conceptual ethics.6 here i just want to think schematically. to be more\nrealistic, we’ll want to say that anti-c arguments end in the verdict that we shouldn’t\ngo in for a certain (probably improper) subset of possible uses of c. or put another\nway: that we shouldn’t use c is settings of type s.7 to be explicit, call these anti-c/s\narguments. this adjustment mandates a corresponding change to our definition of\nhypocrisy. the anti-c/s arguments of interest are just those that make use of c in\nwhat amounts to a setting of type s. (but i’ll suppress this complication for readability\nwhen it’s not relevant.)\nso, should we abjure hypocritical arguments in conceptual ethics  or more\npositively, is it permissible to argue hypocritically \na number of my informants have reported that hypocrisy doesn’t feel inherently\nproblematic to them. sure, there may be something odd about initiating a debate in\nconceptual ethics with a hypocritical argument. but if your interlocutor is already on\nrecord as endorsing the use of some concept c, then using c yourself in the course of\ntrying to persuade her otherwise just feels like “addressing one’s opponent on her\n³ to get closer to the conventional understanding of revisionism, one might add that c is already in\ncirculation, while c* is not.’\n4 for symmetry, one could also call arguments that we can permissibly refrain from using c “anti-c”.\nbut i won’t be concerned with this broader class of conclusions. eliminativism and revisionism, which lie at\nthe heart of conceptual ethics, both involve the stronger claim that we should not use c. and there’s\nnothing prima facie hypocritical or problematic about using c to argue that we can permissibly refrain\nfrom using c.\n5 interestingly, perhaps, there’s no analogue of hypocrisy in conceptual analysis. a circular analysis uses\nc to specify the content of c itself. a circular ethics uses c to argue in favor of using c. a hypocritical ethics\nuses c to argue against using c. but there’s nothing “hypocritical” about using c to specify the content of\nsome other concept, like c’s complement, or an antonym. if anything, that would just be another kind of\ncircularity.\n6 burgess and plunkett (2013).\n7 i like the word ‘setting’ because it’s relatively free of other theoretical associations. i also like that it can\nbe read as both environment/context and “value of a variable”. i think i can enjoy those resonances\nsimultaneously without committing any fallacies of equivocation.\n \n                  \n \n \n  '], [127, '127\nown terms”. cast in this dialectical light, hypocrisy actually looks a lot like good oldfashioned\nreductio.8 witness where the presumption that it’s kosher to use c leads us:\nto the conclusion that it’s not!\nof course, if and when you persuade your opponent that we shouldn’t use c, via\nsome hypocritical argument, she may well reflect on her route to that conclusion,\nnote that it used c, and hence retrospectively disavow the argument.  but that’s just\n“kicking away a ladder” once it’s been climbed. no problem there, right \nthe problem with this kind of ladder-kicking is what gilbert harman (1986: 39)\nhas called the principle of positive undermining. his thought is basically that a\nsubject should stop believing p once she realizes that her basis for that belief isn’t\nactually any good. and unless your opponent above is totally daft, she’ll see that the\nonly reason she eventually came around to your anti-c position (p) was a hypocritical\nargument that she’s now disowned. so, according to harman’s principle, she\nshould now stop believing that we shouldn’t use c. once she kicks away the\nhypocritical ladder, the rational thing to do is jump back down off the roof.¹°\nnow, i don’t take this line of thought to show that there is definitely something\nwrong with hypocritical arguments. after all, i aim to defend hypocrisy in the end.\nbut i do take the harman-inspired point to undermine (or at least problematize) the\nidea that hypocrisy is innocuous just because of its resemblance to reductio.¹¹ and\nwe’ll soon see a simple, direct argument against hypocrisy, which will take some time\nto evaluate.\nfirst, though, i want to spend a moment addressing the significance of getting\nclearer on the status of hypocrisy. officially, a hypocritical argument is an anti-c/s\nargument that uses c in a setting of type s. how often do such arguments actually\ncrop up in conceptual ethics  and how hard is it to reformulate them without\nhypocrisy when they do arise  if it’s not often, or not hard, then maybe we shouldn’t\n8 it’s not really reductio, though. i’m actually not sure how to describe the logical or formal relationship\nbetween the supposition that one can permissibly use c (which merely mentions c) and the first\nsubsequent step of the argument that actually uses c.\n  unless the conclusion of the argument is that we shouldn’t use c outside the scope of a supposition\n(or some such setting s), since we’re assuming the argument only uses c within the scope of a supposition.\nbut if this conclusion was derived by discharging a supposition reduced to absurdity, the supposition must\nhave been that it’s permissible to use c outside the scope of a supposition. but this supposition would not\nhave warranted subsequent use of c within its scope.’\n¹° to make matters more complicated, though: once your opponent has dropped the anti-c view, her\nonly reason for resisting your hypocritical argument is gone! so she should presumably climb the ladder\nonce again. she could keep going around and around in this way indefinitely. but this possibility doesn’t\nmake hypocritical arguments look particularly attractive.’\n¹¹ here’s a reply due to david taylor. nevermind whether hypocritical arguments are themselves\nacceptable. the mere existence of an otherwise compelling hypocritical argument immediately provides\nfor a compelling, non-hypocritical, anti-c argument, along the following lines. initially adopting the pro-c\nposition would lead to a kind of cognitive instability (in light of the previous note), where we’re constantly\nflip-flopping between accepting and rejecting the use of c. this situation is rationally untenable, so we can\nonly embrace the anti-c alternative. (compare my own reply to the objection at the very end of the\npresent chapter.) i’m not sure whether to accept this friendly suggestion, however. for the rational force of\ntaylor’s non-hypocritical argument-form seems to hinge on the status of the associated hypocritical\nargument. if hypocrisy is a disqualifying vice, friends of c can reasonably refuse the first flip-flop. so\nthere may be no avoiding a direct confrontation with the issue of the chapter: whether hypocrisy itself is\nsomehow problematic.\n \n          ‘          “     ” ’     \n \n \n  '], [128, '128\ninvest too much energy in trying to understand or evaluate hypocrisy. these two\nissues are closely related. how “hard” it is to transform a hypocritical argument into a\nnon-hypocritical argument depends in large part on how densely packed the field of\npossible anti-c/s arguments is with hypocritical ones. so let me first speak to this\nbasic statistical issue. and let me bracket setting-sensitivity to begin with.\nconceptual ethics is a part of philosophy that’s preoccupied with concepts. the\nconcepts that interest philosophers tend to be “central” to our ordinary conceptual\nschemes, in the sense that they’re implicated in the analysis of a whole host of other\nconcepts. i’m thinking of things like modal concepts (necessary, contingent), logical\nconcepts (exists, identical), normative concepts (should, right), epistemic concepts\n(know, rational), and so on.¹² since we still do philosophy in something resembling\nnatural language, central concepts like these will inevitably turn up in any sustained\neffort to specify the contents of the bits of language use that make up philosophical\ndiscourse. discourse in conceptual ethics is no exception. any given anti-c argument\ntherefore runs a significant risk of deploying a concept whose analysis involves\nc itself. in a generous sense of “use”—where using the concept vixen, for example,\ninvolves using the concept fox—such an argument would count as hypocritical.¹³\nto get a feel for the size of this risk, let’s play with some numbers. let’s say there\nare 50 central concepts of philosophical interest. and let’s say the average philosophical\nargument (in conceptual ethics) makes overt, explicit use of 30 different\nconcepts (central or otherwise). and let’s say the average conceptual analysis involves\n4 central concepts. of the (30\x014 =) 120 token concepts implicated in the average\nargument, at least 70 have to be redundant (given that there are only 50 central\nconcepts). let’s say as many as 100 are redundant, so that the average non-redundant\nconcept shows up 6 times in the argument. then the chance of hypocrisy would be\n(20/50 =) 40%. that’s pretty high. if there were something terribly wrong with\nhypocritical arguments, this level of risk might be unacceptable.\nsuppose you found yourself arguing hypocritically by accident. how easy would it\nbe to rectify the mistake, without compromising the essential upshot of the argument\nyou were trying to make  i doubt there is any general recipe for converting hypocritical\narguments into equi-plausible, non-hypocritical arguments. and case-by-case\nconversion won’t be as simple as paraphrasing away a few offending words. the\n“paradox” of analysis points up just how hard it is to know in advance which\nconcepts will be implicated in an adequate definition. our best efforts at paraphrase\ncould easily end up introducing new dimensions of hypocrisy, or simply preserving\nold ones.\n¹² some concepts of interest to actual conceptual ethicists probably won’t show up in the analysis of any\nconcepts explicitly used by those ethicists. i’m thinking of slurs, for example, or racial concepts. these are\nnot central to our conceptual schemes in the relevant sense. so if your interest in this book stems mostly\nfrom your interest in concepts like those, this chapter may not be for you.\n¹³ it doesn’t matter if this sense of “use” feels artificial. what’s relevant is whether there’s anything\nintuitively objectionable about using the concept vixen to argue that we shouldn’t use the concept fox. or to\ntake a less frivolous example: whether there’s anything suspicious about using the concept of reliability to\nargue that we shouldn’t use the concept of truth (on the supposition that reliability is properly defined in\nterms of truth). these cases doesn’t feel much better to me than overt, word-for-word hypocrisy.\n\n \n \n  '], [129, '129\ndoesn’t this whole situation look much less dire, though, once we acknowledge the\nsetting-sensitivity of real-life arguments in conceptual ethics  won’t the typical\nhypocritical argument just fall outside the scope of its own s  and even if not,\ncan’t we always just replace s with some s* that excludes the argument by fiat \nnot so fast. first of all, as a purely descriptive matter, the most common settings\nyou’ll find in real-life conceptual ethics are by far, “for ordinary practical purposes”\nand “for serious theoretical purposes”. philosophical arguments may fall outside the\nscope of the former, but they certainly don’t escape the latter. second, excluding an\nargument from its own scope by fiat could be problematically ad hoc. if the modified\nargument featuring s* seems plausible, that’s probably because it borrows luster from\nsome more natural, less gerrymandered argument. take a toy example. compare a\nhypocritical argument that we shouldn’t use the notion of numerical identity “for\nserious theoretical purposes” to a sanitized variant that self-consciously excludes\nnormative theorizing about that very concept. if the second argument is any good,\nthat’s probably due to its being a special case of the first.¹4\nall of which is really just to say that it would certainly be nice if hypocrisy were\ninnocuous. then we could go about our business in conceptual ethics without\nconstantly monitoring the concepts we use to mount our anti-c arguments. unfortunately,\nthere is a simple line of reasoning to the effect that we should never accept\nhypocritical arguments:\nargument x.¹5 for any concept c, any setting-type s, and any hypocritical, anti-c/s argument\nh, either h is sound or it isn’t. if h isn’t sound, then we shouldn’t accept it. so suppose h is\nsound (case two). then its conclusion is true. its conclusion is that we shouldn’t use c in\nsettings of type s. since h is hypocritical, to accept h would be to use c in such a setting.¹6 so\nwe shouldn’t accept h. so, in either case, whether or not h is sound, we shouldn’t accept it.¹7\nit might sound odd to counsel (in case two) against accepting a sound argument.\nsoundness is usually what we tell our students to aspire to. but we all know that some\nsound arguments are dialectically no good: the question-begging ones. argument\nx just goes to show that we should treat hypocrisy similarly.\nthis last observation raises a question of focus for us.¹8 when reflecting on\nconceptual ethics, maybe we ought to be more interested in issues of soundness\nand truth; less interested in issues of method or disputation. metaphysics first,\nepistemology later. to make the complaint vivid, consider a hypocritical one-liner\n(where premise and conclusion collapse into a single claim):\n(z) we should not use ‘should’.¹ \n¹4 here i take issue with scharp (chapter 19, this volume, section 8) on defective concepts in conceptual\nengineering.’\n¹5 interestingly, there doesn’t seem to be any analogous argument against circularity in conceptual\nethics.\n¹6 more generally: to accept an argument that uses c is inter alia to use c yourself.\n¹7 this might be a confusing way to state the conclusion, if ‘should’ means different things in case one\nand case two. in case two, it means whatever ‘should’ means in the conclusion of h. in case one, it’s just\nbeing used to track the sense(s) in which unsound arguments are verboden.\n¹8 thanks to herman cappelen for pressing me here, and inspiring the following digression.\n¹  or never say ‘never’. see eklund (2015: section 5) on conceptual fixed points.\n   \n  '], [130, '130\nif z were true, that would be headline news. it wouldn’t matter much, by comparison,\nwhether we should nevertheless avoid accepting z. so why have i been focusing on\nthe rules of engagement in conceptual ethics rather than the facts on the ground \nnot for any good reason, really. i think these alethic questions are interesting too.\nbut hypocritical one-liners are few and far between in conceptual ethics. (because\nthere are only so many concepts involved in articulating any anti-c view.) and when\nit comes to full-blown arguments, my hunch is that hypocrisy should be no obstacle\nto validity. soundness is a further question. i can imagine someone thinking that\nhypocritical arguments can’t possibly be sound (and that one-liners can’t possibly be\ntrue). but i have no firm view. and however these alethic issues shake out, i do think\nit’s worth wondering whether there’s something independently, dialectically wrong\nwith hypocrisy, in the same vein as begging the question. who knows, though, what\norder we should take all this in. i’m focusing on method mainly because i have\nsomething to say about it. here, then, is the idea that precipitated the present chapter.\nnotice that x isn’t just an argument about conceptual ethics, it’s actually a contribution\nto conceptual ethics. its conclusion says that we shouldn’t accept hypocritical\narguments. but accepting an argument involves using the concepts featured therein.\nso x concerns a normative question about concept use. to be more exact, we could\nregiment its conclusion as a prohibition against using any concept c in a certain type\nof setting: hypocritical arguments. (or more narrowly: arguments that are hypocritical\nwith respect to c specifically; the choice won’t matter.) now, the observation that\nx itself amounts to an argument in conceptual ethics proper doesn’t immediately\nimpugn x. but it does raise an interesting question.\nis x hypocritical  well, we’ve only defined hypocrisy for arguments in conceptual\nethics whose conclusions target individual concepts. so consider an argument generated\nfrom x by universal instantiation on c. and let’s pick a concept explicitly\nused in x, like soundness, acceptance, disjunction, or even hypocrisy itself.\nthe conclusion of this new argument would therefore be that we shouldn’t use the\nconcept of (e.g.) acceptance to mount hypocritical arguments. call the new argument\na, for acceptance:\nargument a. for any setting-type s, and any hypocritical, anti-acceptance/s argument h,\neither h is sound or it isn’t. if h isn’t sound, then we shouldn’t accept it. so suppose h is sound\n(case two). then its conclusion is true. its conclusion is that we shouldn’t use acceptance in\nsettings of type s. since h is hypocritical, to accept h would be to use acceptance in such a\nsetting. so we shouldn’t accept h. so, in either case, whether or not h is sound, we shouldn’t\naccept it. in other words: we shouldn’t use acceptance in h-type settings.\nif there were something problematic about a, then presumably x would inherit the\nproblem.²° so, is a hypocritical  like x, it uses the concept of acceptance. and unlike\nx, its conclusion does specifically say that we shouldn’t use that very concept. but\na only proscribes the use of that concept in settings of a certain type: hypocritical,\n²° even if other instances of x, generated by instantiating c with other concepts, aren’t problematic.\nafter all, to endorse x in full generality is effectively to endorse each and every one of its instances. we\ncould restrict the initial quantifier over c in x just to concepts that aren’t used in x itself. but then we’d\nhave to confront a version of the borrowed luster issue raised earlier.\n \n                  \n \n \n  '], [131, '131\nanti-acceptance arguments. as we’ve just said, a is an anti-acceptance argument. so,\ngiven the definition of hypocrisy, the only thing left for us to check in order to\ndetermine whether a is hypocritical is therefore . . . whether a is hypocritical! if it is,\nit is; and if it isn’t, it isn’t.\nthis predicament is strikingly similar to the situation with truth-teller sentences\nin the literature on the semantic paradoxes, like “this sentence is true”. as far as the\nt-scheme is concerned, all we can say is that the truth-teller is true if it’s true; not if\nit’s not. and it’s not at all clear where else to look for guidance as to the sentence’s\ntruth-value. similarly, it’s unclear what might settle the status of a if not the\ndefinition of hypocrisy (together with a’s intrinsic features).\nwhat follows from all this  at the very least, i think we can conclude that there is\nsomething odd and potentially problematic about a, and therefore x. since x is the\nonly argument we have managed to marshal against hypocrisy, this conclusion\nstrikes me as a significant, if vague, defensive result. i haven’t offered a positive\nargument that hypocrisy is kosher. (recall that i didn’t endorse the argument that\nassimilates hypocritical reasoning to reductio.) i won’t say that hypocrisy is innocent\nuntil proven guilty. but i will stop investing time trying to avoid hypocrisy in\nconceptual ethics until someone comes up with a solid reason.\nobjection. the worst-case scenario you painted above was that a might be\nhypocritical. but you don’t think there’s anything wrong with hypocrisy. so you\nhave no reason to resist a, and therefore no reason to resist x.\nreply. but if we accept x, then we will think there’s something wrong with\nhypocrisy. so accepting x is unstable. moreover, you’ve misdescribed the worstcase\nscenario. the worry was rather that it’s somehow unsettled or indeterminate\nwhether a is hypocritical. whatever you make of (determinate) hypocrisy, this\nliminal status is just weird.\nconclusion. we should not yet conclude that we should not argue hypocritically\nwhen we argue about which concepts we should use.\n\n '], [132, '132\n7\nconceptual engineering\nthe master argument\nherman cappelen\ni call the activity of assessing and developing improvements of our representational\ndevices ‘conceptual engineering’.¹ the aim of this chapter is to present an argument\nfor why conceptual engineering is important for all parts of philosophy (and, more\ngenerally, all inquiry). section i of the chapter provides some background and defines\nkey terms. section ii presents the argument. section iii responds to seven objections.\nthe replies also serve to develop the argument and clarify what conceptual engineering\nis.\ni. background and explanation of central terms\nif we use ‘conceptual engineering’ as i suggested above, that is, to mean the project of\nassessing and developing improvements of our representational devices, then if you\nthink ‘concepts’ are the core representational devices, conceptual engineering\namounts to the following: it is the project of assessing and then ameliorating our\nconcepts.² for example:\n• an epistemological conceptual engineer will, in an ameliorative spirit, assess\nepistemic concepts.\n• a conceptual engineer in moral philosophy will, in an ameliorative spirit, assess\nmoral concepts.\n• a metaphysical ameliorator will, in an ameliorative spirit, assess metaphysical\nconcepts.\n• a semantic ameliorator will, in an ameliorative spirit, assess semantic concepts.\nthis normative project contrasts with a descriptive one. the descriptivist aims to\ndescribe the concepts we have—to describe our epistemic, moral, metaphysical,\nsemantic, and so on, concepts. one important strand in the history of philosophy\n¹ it can also include the activity of trying to implement the proposed improvements (for more on this,\nsee cappelen and plunkett’s introduction to this volume).\n² in cappelen (2018), i end up not describing conceptual engineering in this way, but the argument in\nthis chapter can be presented independently of those reservations.\n \n '], [133, '133\nis a battle (or tension or at least division³) between descriptivists and revisionists.\nthe distinction will not be simple or clear-cut and the battle lines have been drawn in\ndifferent ways in different time periods. but in each time period and in all parts of\nphilosophy, we find these two fundamentally conflicting attitudes or goals. for some,\nsuccess is measured by a true description of, for example, what knowledge, belief,\nmorality, representation, justice, or beauty is. for others, the aim is figuring out how\nwe improve on what we have: how can we improve on (our concepts of) knowledge,\njustice, belief, beauty, etc.? those with the former aim tend to find the latter\nunintelligible (or naive) and those with the latter aim tend to find the former\ncomplacent, uninspired, and lazy.\nnietzsche is perhaps the paradigm of a philosopher advocating what he calls\n‘absolute skepticism’ towards our inherited concepts. in the will to power, he writes:\nphilosophers . . . have trusted in concepts as completely as they have mistrusted the senses: they\nhave not stopped to consider that concepts and words are our inheritance from ages in which\nthinking was very modest and unclear . . . .what dawns on philosophers last of all: they must no\nlonger accept concepts as a gift, nor merely purify and polish them, but first make and create\nthem, present them and make them convincing. hitherto one has generally trusted one’s\nconcepts as if they were a wonderful dowry from some sort of wonderland: but they are,\nafter all, the inheritance from our most remote, most foolish as well as most intelligent\nancestors. . . . what is needed above all is an absolute skepticism toward all inherited concepts\n(nietzsche 1901/1968: section 409)\nstrawson thought about the history of philosophy in part as a battle between\nrevisionists, like nietzsche, and what he called descriptivists. at the beginning of\nindividuals he distinguishes between descriptive and revisionary metaphysics:\ndescriptive metaphysics is content to describe the actual structure of our thought about the\nworld, revisionary metaphysics is concerned to produce a better structure. (1959: 9)\none of his characterizations of the revisionists’ objection to descriptivists is acute.\nhe imagines the revisionist insisting that metaphysics is\n. . . essentially an instrument of conceptual change, a means of furthering or registering new\ndirections or styles of thought. (1959: 10)\nin that brief introduction strawson also gestures at a way of writing a history of\nphilosophy based on the distinction between descriptivists and revisionists. he says\n[p]erhaps no actual metaphysician has ever been, both in intention and effect, wholly the one\nthing or the other. but we can distinguish broadly: descartes, leibniz, berkeley are revisionary,\naristotle and kant descriptive. hume, the ironist of philosophy, is more difficult to place.\nhe appears now under one aspect, now under another. (1959: 9)\nthis contrast is salient in many philosophical domains today. there are lively\nrevisionist projects in moral philosophy, theories of truth and logic, feminist and\n³ how best to describe it is discussed further in connection with objection (7) below.\n \n '], [134, '134\nrace theory, and so on.4 at the same time, there are descriptive projects dominating\nlarge swaths of philosophy. the paradigm might be epistemologists’ endless efforts to\ncorrectly describe what the english word ‘knows’ means.5 the same kind of descriptivist\naim is found throughout philosophy: just think of the obsession within the\nphilosophy of language with the minutiae of natural language and its semantics (e.g.,\nthe now-over-a-century-long debate about how the word ‘the’ works in english, or\nthe flurry of work on the english word ‘if ’), or efforts to describe our concepts of\n‘freedom’, or ‘self ’, or ‘object’. these are more often than not pursued as purely\ndescriptive enterprises. success is measured by descriptive adequacy—not by answering\nthe question what should those words mean? and what should the relevant\nconcepts be?6\nii. the master argument\nthe argument i’ll be defending in what follows—‘the master argument’—is in no\nway original to me. it is a line of thought that can be seen as motivating many\nrevisionist projects.7 nonetheless, the argument in full generality is often left implicit.\nthe aim in what follows is to articulate the most general (not domain specific)\nversion of the argument and then consider a range of objections to it.\nthe master argument:\n1. if w is a word8 that has a meaning m, then there are many similar meanings,\nm1,m2, . . . ,mn, w could have.\n2. we have no good reason to think that the meaning thatwended up with is the\nbest meaningwcould have: there will typically be indefinitely many alternative\nmeanings that would be better meanings for w.\n3. when we speak, think, and theorize it’s important to make sure our words have\nas good meanings as possible.?\n4. as a corollary: when doing philosophy, we should try to find good meanings for\ncore philosophical terms and they will typically not be the meanings those\nwords as a matter of fact have.\n4 the literature is large here. a representative selection is: railton (1989, 1993) for moral philosophy;\nscharp (2013) and eklund (2014) for truth and logic; and haslanger (2012) and appiah (1992) for the\nphilosophies of gender and race. see my fixing language (2018: chapter 2, section 1), for a more\ncomplete list.\n5 what robert pasnau laments, in his 2013, as the degeneration of epistemology into lexicography.\n6 for a brief history of the tension between revisionist and descriptivists in twentieth-century philosophy,\nsee cappelen 2018: chapter 2.\n7 see, for example, chalmers 2011 and eklund 2014, and the work in general of david plunkett and\ntimothy sundell (2013), and of haslanger (many of the papers collected in her 2012).\n8 in this chapter i don’t individuate words semantically. if you like to use the word ‘word’ so that it\ndenotes a lexical item that has its meaning essentially, then you can translate from your way of speaking to\nmine by substituting ‘lexical item’ for ‘word’ in this chapter. the metaphysics of words is difficult and\nrelevant, but not addressed in this chapter (see kaplan 1990 and cappelen 1999 for some discussion).\n? or, as david plunkett suggested to me, maybe ‘good enough meanings’ is good enough. maybe aiming\nfor ‘best possible’ is too ambitious. i’m open-minded on this issue. this is one of several places where one\ncan articulate related versions of the master argument.\n \n \n '], [135, '135\n5. so no matter what topic a philosopher is concerned with, they should assess\nand ameliorate the meanings of central terms¹°.\nthis is a controversial argument that builds in many assumptions. i take the\nproject of outlining a general theory of conceptual engineering to be, in large part,\nthe project of defending this kind of argument. in contrast, most work done on\nconceptual engineering is domain-specific and done by those working in those\ndomains. for example, you might be interested in questions such as:\n• what should our moral concepts be like?\n• what should our gender and race concepts be like?\n• what should our concepts of, say, civilian or person or family or terrorist or\ntruth be?\nthose specific topics derive their significance from the importance of the specific\nsubject matters addressed. the master argument, on the other hand, isn’t domainspecific.\nthis, i take it, shows that there is a general research project here, that is of\ninterest independently of the case studies.\niii. replies to seven objections\nin what follows i address seven related objections to the master argument:\n• objection (1): why think that if a word, w, has a meaning m, then there are\nmany similar meanings w could have?\n• objection (2): in what sense can one meaning be better than another?\n• objection (3): why not think the meanings words have are the best they can be\n(or at least very, very good)?\n• objection (4): if we change the meaning of an expression, won’t that result in\nmassive verbal disputes and changes of topic?\n• objection (5): aren’t meaning assignments normatively neutral, as long as each\nthing worth meaning is meant by some word or other? some things are worth\nmeaning, but why does it matter whether a given word means one of those\nthings or something else?\n• objection (6): why think the importance of the revisionist project undermines\nthe importance of the descriptive project? why think there’s a tension between\nthe two approaches? aren’t they complementary?\n• objection (7): if we are to engage in conceptual engineering, don’t we have to\nassume that meaning assignments are within our control? if they are out of our\ncontrol, how can we meaningfully engage in conceptual engineering?\nin answering these objections, i hope to (a), clarify the nature of conceptual\nengineering, and (b), outline the central challenges for conceptual engineering as a\nfield.\n¹° as will become clear below, amelioration sometimes involves improving the meaning while keeping\nthe lexical item fixed, and sometimes it involves the introduction of a new lexical item with an improved\nmeaning.\n \n '], [136, '136\nobjection (1): why think that if a word, w, has a meaning m,\nthen there are many similar meanings w could have?\ni respond to this objection in two steps: first, i motivate the idea of similar meanings,\nand then the idea that w could have one of these similar meanings.\non the idea of similar meanings: there’s little agreement on what meanings are\nand the master argument is neutral on that foundational issue. however, it’s hard\nto think of any account of what meanings are that’s incompatible with this claim.\na way to illustrate this is to think, in common with many philosophers, of\nmeanings as at least intensions, that is, functions from points of evaluation to\nextensions.¹¹ so ‘freedom’, ‘knows’, ‘justice’, ‘belief ’, and all other expressions are\nassociated with an intension and this intension is a function that gives a value (an\nextension) for each point of evaluation. now, just change the function a little bit\nand you have a similar but different meaning (if meanings either are or determine\nintensions). suppose, for example, ‘knows’ picks out a relation between an agent\nand a content. the literature on the definition of ‘knows’ has given us literally\nhundreds of proposals for intensions of ‘knows’ that are very similar—they differ a\ntiny bit on how to deal with gettier cases or lottery cases or some other weird\nscenarios, but are otherwise very similar. ‘knows’ presumably picks out one of\nthese functions, but there are very many similar ones.\non the idea that words can change from one meaning to another one: so far so\ngood, but why think that once a meaning has been fixed, it is changeable? why not\nthink that meaning assignments get fixed and then are stuck eternally? first-pass\nanswer: a word, say ‘marriage’ could mean anything. we could, right now, use it to\nmean what ‘camel’ or ‘soup’ does. there’s nothing in that sign that makes those\nmeaning assignments impossible. if it’s possible, now, for ‘marriage’ to mean camel,\nthen it could also mean one of the meanings that are similar to its current meaning.\nin reply to this one might think that conceptual engineering is a matter of\nimplementing gradual changes, not the kind of change exemplified by the possibility\nof assigning camel as the meaning of ‘marriage’. however, we know that\nthere can be such gradual changes and that they happen constantly. historical or\ndiachronic linguistics is a field devoted entirely to the study of various forms of\nsyntactic and semantic changes over time. these fields are in part the study of how\nmeanings of words evolve gradually (from one meaning to a similar one) over\ntime. the claim that gradual semantic change is impossible is refuted by the\nfindings of these well-established research fields.\ntwo issues raised by this reply will be addressed later:\na) i just argued that meaning adjustment is possible. i didn’t say that it was easy or\nwithin our control. i return to the question of how we can (or cannot) be in\ncontrol of meaning change in reply to objection (7) below.\n¹¹ for the purposes of this chapter, i will be neutral on what points of evaluation are—they might be\nworlds, world/time pairs or something more complicated. i don’t need to take a stand on those issues in\nthis chapter (though i do have views, for which, see cappelen and hawthorne 2009).\n\n '], [137, '137\nb) i’ve focused on cases where we want to improve the meaning of a particular\nlexical item. in some cases, we don’t care about the lexical item in question, but\nrather want to introduce a new lexical item for the improved or alternative\nmeaning. there’s a range of options here and they’re discussed in reply to\nobjection (5) below.\nobjection (2): in what sense can one meaning be better than another?\nthere’s an extensive philosophical tradition for thinking that the concepts or meanings\nour words express can be defective and can be improved along various dimensions, and\nso for thinking that some meanings can be better than others. this view can be found\nthroughout the history of philosophy, but in what follows i’ll focus on some versions\nfound in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. carnap’s idea that intellectual work\ntypically involves explication is a paradigm. the core thought was that the meanings\nwe assigned to our words could be defective and for carnap the central defects were\nindeterminacy and vagueness. explication was a process of improvement. for carnap,\nimprovements were measured relativized to purposes. here is how anil gupta explains\nthe difference between an absolute and purpose-relative improvement:\nan explication aims to respect some central uses of a term but is stipulative on others.\nthe explication may be offered as an absolute improvement of an existing, imperfect concept.\nor, it may be offered as a ‘good thing to mean’ by the term in a specific context for a particular\npurpose. (gupta 2015: section 1.5)\ni’d like to focus on the idea that an explication is a ‘good thing to mean’ by the term in\na specific context for a particular purpose. here is an illustration from gupta:\nthe truth-functional conditional provides another illustration of explication. this conditional\ndiffers from the ordinary conditional in some essential respects. nevertheless, the truthfunctional\nconditional can be put forward as an explication of the ordinary conditional for\ncertain purposes in certain contexts. whether the proposal is adequate depends crucially on the\npurposes and contexts in question. that the two conditionals differ in important, even\nessential, respects does not automatically disqualify the proposal. (gupta 2015: section 1.5)\nmuch the same idea of explication can be found in quine’s word and object (quine\n1960), where quine writes about explication:\nwe do not claim synonymy. we do not claim to make clear and explicit what the users of the\nunclear expression had unconsciously in mind all along. we do not expose hidden meanings,\nas the words ‘analysis’ and ‘explication’ would suggest; we supply lacks. we fix on the particular\nfunctions of the unclear expression that make it worth troubling about, and then devise a\nsubstitute, clear and couched in terms to our liking, that fills those functions. beyond those\nconditions of partial agreement, dictated by our interests and purposes, any traits of the\nexplicans come under the head of “don’t-cares” (§38). under this head we are free to allow\nthe explicans. (quine 1960: 258\x019)\non this more general understanding of explication, there is no unique correct\nexplication of any term, the improvement is relative to contextually specific purposes.\nwith that in mind, there is no reason why there should be a fixed set of theoretical\n \n '], [138, '138\nvirtues that are used to measure improvement. in certain contexts, non-theoretical\nvirtues/advantages could make a big difference.\nso understood, much work in social and political philosophy can be seen as a\ncontinuation of carnap’s proposal. take, for example, sally haslanger’s work on\ngender and race concepts. an important element of that work is a proposal for how\ngender and race terms can be ameliorated, that is, can be given better meanings.\nthe dimensions of assessment that she has in mind are different from carnap’s, but\nthey are part of the same general project: of improving our concept along many and\ndiverse dimensions.\na great deal of philosophy engages in this form of amelioration, often without\nmaking a big deal out of it. consider, for example, clark and chalmers’ paper\n‘the extended mind’ (1998). clark and chalmers propose, among other things,\nthat ‘a believes that p’ be used in a way that makes it true even when p is a\nproposition that a has access to only with the assistance of various ‘external’ devices\n(clark and chalmers 1998). in connection with that proposal, they consider various\nobjections of the form: well, that’s just not how we use ‘belief ’ in english. in response\nthey say:\nwe do not intend to debate what is standard usage; our broader point is that the notion of\nbelief ought to be used so that otto qualifies as having the belief in question. in all important\nrespects, otto’s case is similar to a standard case of (non-occurrent) belief [ . . . ] by using the\n‘belief ’ notion in a wider way, it picks out something more akin to a natural kind. the notion\nbecomes deeper and more unified, and is more useful in explanation.\n(clark and chalmers 1998: 14)\nclark and chalmers’ goal is not primarily to describe our current concept of\nbelief—they want to revise our concept. note two particularly important features of\nthe proposal. (i) their revision changes both the extension and the intension of the\nconcept of ‘belief ’. (ii) they briefly provide a justification for the revision: it is, they\nsay, more useful in explanations. their new revised concept is also ‘deeper’ and ‘more\nunified’. so our current notion is defective, as it is not sufficiently unified, not\nsufficiently deep, and not sufficiently useful in explanations. these kind of ameliorative\nmoves are made in all parts of philosophy. for some salient recent examples\nthink of haslanger’s work on race and gender concepts, eklund and scharp on truth,\nand railton’s proposed revision of core moral terms (see footnote 4 for references).\nfor a wide range of illustrations, see plunkett and sundell (ms); ludlow (2014); and\ncappelen (2018: chapter 2). beyond philosophy it’s easy to find lively debates about\n(what at least looks like) meaning assignments. consider discussions about what\nshould be in the extension of ‘torture’, or ‘person’, or ‘marriage’, or ‘rape’. these are\nnot plausibly construed simply as efforts to find a descriptively adequate account of\nwhat these words actually mean. imagine if a semantically omniscient god told us\nthat ‘torture’ has a semantic value that doesn’t include waterboarding. that’s\nextremely unlikely to stop the debate over whether waterboarding is torture. one\nway to explain, that is, to construe it as a debate over whether ‘torture’ should have a\nmeaning that makes it include waterboarding in its extension.\nso far, i’ve simply pointed out that there are people who think meanings can be\nimproved. it goes beyond the scope of this chapter to assess each of these proposals.\n \n '], [139, '139\nsuffice it to say that if you find one or more of those views plausible, you should be on\nboard with a version of premise (2) in the argument.\nit is, however, worth considering the denial of the claim that meaning assignments\ncan be assessed. this is the view that there’s no normative dimension along which\none meaning for w can be better than an alternative meaning. more generally:\ncomplete neutrality: meaning assignments are always normatively neutral.\nto assess complete neutrality, consider the fact that meaning assignments have a\nhuge influence on what we can think about and how we can think about those\nfeatures of the world that we can think about. both of these have all kinds of effects\non humans, both inter- and intra-personally. to hold that those effects cannot be\nassessed seems implausible for a range of simple reasons: if, for example, fs are\nimportant to a group of agents, then it’s good for them to be able to think about fs\nand not good if they can’t think about fs. if, however, thinking, theorizing, or\ndiscussing fs is unfortunate for those agents, then nevertheless having an expression\nthat denotes fs is worse than not having one.\nobjection (3): why not think the meanings words\nhave are the best they can be (or need to be)?\ni hope objection (3) sounds silly: it’s implausible that a cultural artifact that’s\ngenerated in a messy, largely incomprehensible way that’s outside our control¹²\nshould end up producing something we can’t improve on. everything we humans\nproduce can be improved—why think meaning assignments are ideal (or good\nenough) straight off? even if there are degrees of appropriateness, it would be\namazing if we got exactly the right degree right off the bat.\na natural thought in this vicinity is nicely captured by austin. in ‘a plea for\nexcuses’ austin says that “ordinary language . . . embodies . . . the inherited experience\nand acumen of many generations of men. . . . if a distinction works well for practical\npurposes in ordinary life (no mean feat, for even ordinary life is full of hard cases),\nthen there is sure to be something in it, it will not mark nothing” (austin 1956: 11).\naustin might be right: the carvings up that have survived over many generations are\nlikely to ‘mark something’. but note that even if this is true, we’re not even close to\nthe claim that there’s no room for improvement. the austinian thought gives us\nreason to think we’re not totally wasting our time thinking with, say, the predicates\nwe have, but in no way moves us towards the claim that they can’t or shouldn’t be\nimproved. this is of course recognized by austin who goes on to say that ‘ . . . ordinary\nlanguage is not the last word: in principle it can everywhere be supplemented and\nimproved upon and superseded.’ (austin 1956: 11). the challenge here is to recognize\nwhen ordinary language is good enough and when it can be improved upon.\nthis is a deeply normative project, not primarily a descriptive one, and it is continuous\nwith the kind of engineering projects described above. in the passage from the\nwill to power, quoted above, nietzsche points out that our concepts are ‘the\ninheritance from our most remote, most foolish as well as most intelligent ancestors’.\n¹² or at least so i argue in reply to objection (8) below.\n \n '], [140, '140\ngiven the impact of the most foolish, it would be naive in the extreme to trust our\nconceptual dowry in any domain.\naustin connects the survival of what he calls ‘a distinction’ to the promotion of\ncertain purposes. again, as nietzsche points out, these purposes are typically remote\nand often the purposes of fools. as purposes change (maybe because some of us\nbecome less foolish) we need to adjust the way we carve things up. sometimes this\nwill be the result of moral and political evolutions. in other cases, the changes are\ndriven by needs and purposes that result from technological changes. in yet other\ncases, the changes are the result of theoretical developments. as purposes change,\nmeanings need to change as well. this is yet another reason to endorse an attitude\ncloser to nietzsche than to austin: continuous and radical scepticism towards\ninherited concepts and distinctions.\nobjection (4): if we change the meaning of an expression, won’t that result\nin massive verbal disputes and a change of topic?\nmany philosophers have had concerns roughly of the following form. suppose ‘f’\nmeans m. we then ameliorate and in so doing revise the meaning of ‘f’. the\nfollowing will be the result: pre-ameliorators using ‘f’ will be talking about something\nother than those using ‘f’ post-amelioration. the result of the amelioration will be a\nchange of topic. that, again, can lead to verbal disputes: the pre-ameliorator asserted\n‘fs are g’ and the post-ameliorators say ‘fs are not g’. it looks like a disagreement,\nbut if there’s been a change in meaning of ‘f’, then there’s no disagreement.\nmoreover, if people pre-amelioration had put massive effort into trying to answer\nthe question: ‘are fs g?’; it now looks like we’ve lost track of that question. the\nquestion asked by post-ameliorators when they utter ‘are fs g?’ is a different\nquestion.\nworries of this sort constantly come up in discussions of revisionary traditions in\nphilosophy. my favorite illustration is strawson’s objection to carnap’s account of\nexplication (in his 1963) but we find the same kinds of concerns in the work of, for\nexample, haslanger and railton.\nthis is a concern i take seriously and much of my (2018) fixing language is an\neffort to respond to objection (4). here is a summary of the reply:\nwe know independently of considerations having to do with conceptual engineering\nthat speakers who use the same sentence, s, with different but relevantly\nsimilar semantic contents, can use s to say the same thing. so suppose a and\nb both utter s, but the semantic value of s differs a bit in their two utterances (say,\nbecause they occupy slightly different contexts.) we can still, in many contexts,\nreport them by saying that they have both said that s. that’s to say, we can use s to\nsay what they have both said. so same-saying can be preserved across differences\nin semantic content. i suggest we use that as a model for what happens when\nmeanings are ameliorated as described above. the result is a change in, at least,\nextensions and intensions, but that’s consistent with a preservation of samesaying.\nif it can preserve same-saying, there’s a sense in which they both talk\nabout the same subject matter. i call this a preservation of topics. so even though\nthe meaning of, say, ‘family’ can change over time, we can still say that there’s\n \n\n '], [141, '141\ncontinuity of topic among those who use ‘family’: they are talking about families.\nevidence for this is that two speakers who utter ‘families are g’, one preamelioration\nand one post-amelioration, can both be described as having said\nthat families are g.\nto endorse this you need to buy a collection of claims that that can be summarized as\nfollows:\n• first, you have to accept that same-saying can be preserved despite semantic\ndifferences. same-saying data from speakers who use context sensitive terms is\nan important source of evidence here. an adjective like ‘smart’, for example, will\nfix a comparison class (or a cut off on a scale) in context. there can be two\nutterances of ‘jill is smart’ where the comparison class or cut off differs a bit (i.e.,\nthey have different semantic contents), but where it is true to say that both a and\nb said that jill is smart. so this is evidence that same-saying can be preserved\nacross semantic difference. i think it’s fair to say that there’s a broad consensus\nabout this and that it constitutes more or less common ground among many of\nthose who think about meaning and communication. (for more on this, see\ncappelen and lepore 2005.)\n• second, you have to accept that this notion of same-saying across semantic\ndifference can be used to establish a notion of topics and topic-preservation that\ncovers what happens when we engage in conceptual engineering. alternatively,\nyou could take ‘sameness of topic’ as a primitive and use it to explain why we\ntreat speakers as samesayers. either way, i suggest we treat this cluster of\nconcepts as basic and not aim for a reduction. the core question, for a theory\nof same-saying or topic-preservation, is what theoretical use they can be put to.\ni explore these issues further in section iii of my (2018) of fixing language and my\nconjecture is that even those who oppose the austerity framework that i develop\nthere can endorse this part of it.\nobjection (5): aren’t meaning assignments normatively neutral, as long\nas each thing worth meaning is meant by some word or other?\nsome things are worth meaning, but it doesn’t matter whether a given word means\none of those things or something else. suppose we’ve established the meaning of a\nword, w, is defective along some important dimension and we come up with an\nameliorative strategy. a natural question is: when implementing this strategy, why\nkeep using w? since you’re introducing a new (allegedly improved) meaning,\nwhy not use a new word to mark the change? this is an important question.¹³\nin what follows, i’ll articulate it as a choice between lexical expansion and lexical\nimprovement:\n¹³ this useful articulation of the objection is due to alexis burgess. a discussion with cian dorr also\nhelped me get a bit clearer on all of this. for a discussion of related issues and an opposing conclusion, see\ndever (chapter 8, this volume).\n\n '], [142, '142\nlexical expansion: where a new meaning is introduced as the meaning of a new\nexpression.\nlexical improvement: where a new meaning replaces the meaning of an already\n‘in use’ lexical item has.\nthe objection say: we have no reason to prefer improvement over expansion. the\nunderlying thesis is pro-expansion:\nalways-expand: new meanings should always be attached to new lexical items.\none way to motivate always-expand is through thinking about a strategy involved in\nwhat chalmers (2011) calls ‘the subscript gambit’. according to chalmers, most\nphilosophical concepts are surrounded by similar concepts which constitute clusters.\nfor example, there’s a bunch of concepts in the vicinity of the concept of freedom.\nthe english word ‘free’ might pick out one of those, but we should not think that the\nconcept our word happens to pick out is particularly interesting or useful. what we\nshould do instead is explore the entire conceptual neighbourhood, and then introduce\na range of new expressions. chalmers tends to describe these using subscripts,\nso we have ‘freedom1’, freedom2’, . . . , freedomn’.we should keep each of these in our\nconceptual arsenal, so to speak. they can be useful for different purposes—and\nhaving all of them lexicalized enables us to express a wider range of truths.\nchalmers thinks philosophers have spent too much time (thinking they are)\nfighting over what freedom really is by asking the question “which one of freedom1,\nfreedom2, . . . , freedomn is really freedom?” (although they wouldn’t phrase it that\nway, of course). as he sees it, that’s a fight over what the semantic value of ‘freedom’\nsimplicter is, and that is an uninteresting question. chalmers’s thought is similar to\nthe one in the master argument: the english word ‘free’ has ended up with a\nparticular semantic value, but it could easily have had any of a bunch of similar\nmeaning. that it ended up with the particular meaning it has is in part the result\nof random and intellectually insignificant factors. chalmers (2011) goes further.\nhe says that obsessing over what that semantic value is can only be motivated by a\n‘fetishistic’ value system.\nwith that as a background, the motivation for objection (5) and always-expand\nshould be clear: just as it would be irrational to care about which freedom-concept is\nassigned to ‘freedom1’ and which to ‘freedom2’, it doesn’t matter which freedom\nconcept is assigned to ‘freedom’. what matters is that we articulate and lexicalize the\nrange of interesting concepts in this vicinity.\nbefore turning to my reply, a couple of initial remarks:\n• first notice that a proponent of always-expand is deeply involved in the core\nactivities of conceptual engineering: evaluating meanings and reflecting on\nameliorative strategies. she is not opposed to conceptual engineering, but is\nmaking a particular proposal for how ameliorative strategies should be\nimplemented.\n• choice of lexical items is important. if always-expand is true, that’s a deep fact\nabout the practice of conceptual engineering. in other words, i don’t think this is\njust a trivial issue about words, because issues about words are hardly ever\ntrivial.\n \n '], [143, '143\nthat said, i think always-expand is false: sometimes it is important to preserve\nthe lexical item. here are four considerations against always-expand:\n\nthe lexical item itself can have cognitive and non-cognitive effects on us that we want\nto preserve. in my fixing language (2018: chapter 11), i call these ‘lexical effects.’\nhere are some illustrations:\n• brand names: there is a reason why companies spend an enormous amount of\nresources protecting their brand names. 80\x0190% of the value of the coca-cola\ncompany lies in its ownership of the name ‘coca-cola’.¹4 what does that mean?\nit is of course complicated, but one thing it means is that if coca cola had to\nchange the name of its core product, then the value of the company as a whole\nwould decline dramatically. what’s important for our purposes is this: in a\nscenario where the company was not allowed to put words ‘coca-cola’ on their\nproduct, people’s propensity for buying and consuming the product would\ndecline. this proves that choice of lexical item matters. a proponent of\nalways-expand wouldn’t be able to convince coca-cola executives that the\nname of their product is irrelevant.\n• names of children: that words’ lexical properties affect people in interesting\nways is shown by a study on how political affiliation influences the way parents\nname their children. as surprising as it might (or, on further reflection, might\nnot) seem, there is a correlation between what a child is named and the political\naffiliation of the parents who name it. in particular, a study suggested that\nparents in liberal neighbourhoods are more likely to opt for ‘soft’ letters in\nnaming their child, such as ‘l’s and ‘m’s, while conservative people are more\nlikely to opt for harder sounds like ‘k’ or ‘t’. thus baby liam is more likely to be\nthe product of liberals while kurt might follow in his parents’ footsteps and\nbecome conservative.¹5\n• the kind of signalling that is involved in name choices is, again, not about the\nmeaning of the name (or the meaning of sentences containing the name). it is\nabout triggering certain kinds of lexical effects and what the study shows is that\nparents’ choices are guided by lexical effects even when they are not aware of it.\n• finally, some of the debate over the term ‘marriage’ illustrates the point. the\nword ‘marriage’ has a certain effect on people and in the debate over same-sex\nmarriage it was important for proponents that the lexical item ‘marriage’ was\nused about their relationship. to see that, note that the following wouldn’t\nsuffice to meet the demands of all proponents of same-sex marriage: a proposal\nto introduce another term—say, ‘zwagglebuggle’—that denotes the same rights\nand obligations as ‘marriage’ and same-sex couples could say that they were\n‘zwagglebuggled’, but weren’t entitled to use the term ‘marriage’ about their\nrelationship. one reason why some proponents of same-sex marriage would\n¹4 the economist aswath damodaran gives an analysis of the value of the coca cola brand name in a\nblog post at http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2013/10/the-brand-name-advantage-valuable.html\n¹5 https://www.livescience.com/37196-politics-baby-names.html\n \n\n '], [144, '144\nreject this is that the lexical item ‘marriage’ has important cognitive and\nnon-cognitive effects and those are important in the debate over ‘same-sex\nmarriage’. the aim is, at least in part, to change of meaning of ‘marriage’.¹6,¹7\nthese are not isolated examples. as chalmers point out:\nideal agents might be unaffected by which terms are used for which concepts, but for nonideal\nagents such as ourselves, the accepted meaning for a key term will make a difference to which\nconcepts are highlighted, which questions can easily be raised, and which associations and\ninferences are naturally made. (chalmers 2011: 542)\nmany words have a massive effect in social, political, legal, medical, and interpersonal\ncontexts. we have no reason to think theoretical contexts are immune to\nthese kinds of effects. in cases where preservation of lexical effects are important,\namelioration will involve changing the meaning of the current word, not introducing\na new word. i think lexical effects are ubiquitous and of enormous importance to\ncommunication. they are poorly understood and under-investigated (chapter 11 of\nmy (2018) fixing language provides the beginning of a theory).\n\nin reply to objection (4), i outlined an account of topic continuity across semantic\nchanges. i’ll use ‘freedom’ as an example. suppose that at time t ‘freedom’ denotes a\ncertain property, p. then a semantic change happens, and as a result, at time t1,\n‘freedom’ denotes a different property, p*. this does not prevent there from being\ncontinuity of topic in uses of ‘freedom’ at t and t1. speakers who, at t, utter ‘freedom\nis g’ and speakers who, at t1, utter ‘freedom is g’ can say the same thing. they can all\nbe talking about freedom and say about it that it is g. the topic—freedom—can be\npreserved through semantic changes. that is an important kind of continuity in\ndiscourse. this continuity is why we can say about speakers at t and t1 that they are\ntrying to answer the same questions and it’s what underpins their agreement. now\nsuppose we left the word ‘freedom’ behind and instead introduced indefinitely many\nnew words ‘barakuns’,‘hostomas’, ‘notacabil’, etc., for each new meaning. in that case\nwe would lose an important marker of discourse continuity. the connection to\nprevious discourse would disappear. continuity of lexical item is an important\nmarker of topic continuity.\nin response to what i said above, a proponent of always-expand could say:\nyou say continuity of lexical item is important, but is it essential? it might be no more than a\ncontingent heuristic—useful for restricted agents like humans, but in principle dispensable.\nideally we should just name all the different properties in the freedom neighborhood, and then\nsome of these (or many of them) would constitute topic continuity. an ideal agent wouldn’t\nneed lexical continuity to recognize that continuity.\n¹6 i’m here assuming, for illustrative purposes, that this involves a meaning change. it’s an open\nquestion whether it does.\n¹7 this is a point chalmers agrees with: he is clear that in some—maybe many—cases, words matter (see\nthe discussion of ‘torture’ in his 2011). chalmers himself isn’t a proponent of always-expand (his view was\nintroduced because parts of his view could be (ab)used by someone sympathetic to that thesis.)\n \n '], [145, '145\nin reply, i would point out that the communicative features that are important for\nnon-ideal agents matter to us. humans are very much non-ideal and lexical continuity\nis what we—with our limited minds and fragile access to semantic and\ncommunicative content—often need to track topic continuity. maybe it’s not needed\nby gods or by massively improved humans but that does not make it less important\nfor us (who are not gods or cognitively enhanced). here is one way to see why we\nneed it: we care about inter-contextual and inter-conversational continuity. we can\nindividuate conversations so that they last over long time, take place in different\nplaces, and involve broad range of people who will never know one another. people\nwho will never meet each other can participate in a conversation about, say, democracy\nand terrorism. technology has changed the paradigm of a conversation: it’s no\nlonger a group of people standing within hearing distance of each other, it is, rather,\npeople transmitting data across the internet to people they might never encounter.\nsince words don’t come with little definitions attached or lines that mark topic\ncontinuity, we often have to use lexical continuity as markers of topic continuity.\nwhat ties conversations about democracy or terrorism together is often ‘democracy’\nand ‘terrorism’. if someone started using ‘swugleding’ for an ameliorated meaning of\n‘terrorism’, that would most likely fail to connect to the continuous conversations\nabout freedom. there are millions of existing tokens of ‘terrorism’ and the best way\nfor you to connect to those is to use ‘terrorism’. ‘swugleding’ likely won’t do the work,\nno matter how carefully introduced. even ‘terrorism*’ will most likely fail because\nhardly anyone will have access to the meaning of the ‘*’.¹8\nto see what i have in mind, consider again the subscript strategy. it start with\nfreedom and then finds properties in the vicinity (or neighbourhood) of it. the\nsubscript strategy presupposes that there is a freedom cluster. it presupposes that\nsome properties are within the freedom cluster and other properties are not. for\nexample, the property of being one of my eyes isn’t in the freedom cluster (speaking\nin the subscript lingo: it’s not a candidate for being one of ‘freedom1’, ‘freedom2’,\netc.). that’s because it’s not one of the properties in the neighbourhood of freedom.\nthe metaphors of ‘neighbourhood’ and ‘clusters’ play important roles in the description\njust given and we need an account of what demarcates the clusters or neighbourhoods.\ni tacitly introduced such a criterion (in connection with the example of\nfreedom): it has to be appropriately/relevantly related to freedom (without a subscript).\nwe have no other place to start. when theorizing we start with freedom (or,\nmore generally, one of the non-subscripted lexical elements) and then we find\nproperties that are related to it. if that’s the general strategy, we need ‘freedom’\nsimpliciter as the anchor point for amelioration. it is what topic continuity (being\nabout freedom) is measured relative to. if something like that is right, then an appeal\n¹8 note: i am not saying that it is always important to preserve a lexical item. the claim is that lexical\npreservation often matters.\n \n\n \n'], [146, '146\nto freedom simpliciter might be theoretically indispensable if you want to preserve\ntopic continuity.¹?,²°\n\naccording to many views of social ontology, language plays an important role in the\ncreation and preservations of social facts.²¹ there isn’t much agreement on just what\nthat role is, but there is fairly broad agreement that it plays a role. much here is going\nto depend on the exact role language plays and which part of language is most\nimportant, and settling these issues goes beyond the scope of this chapter. with all\nthose reservations in place, there is an important conditional claim:\npossible connection between lexical items and social facts: if lexical items play\nsome role in the creation and preservation of social facts, then changing the\nmeaning of a lexical item might contribute to a change in social reality.\nillustration: suppose a term like ‘family’ plays a role in creating and sustaining the\nsocial category of families. if so, then improving the meaning of ‘family’ can be\ncontribute to a change and maybe also an improvement in that part of social reality—\nit can change/ameliorate the social category of families. suppose, instead, we introduce\na new term, ‘scramies’ with the improved meaning. that might not have the\nsame effect.\nthis point is made with a lot of ‘might’s and ‘maybe’s. we don’t yet know enough\nabout the role of language (and expressions in particular) to make confident claims\nhere. it’s an important issue that conceptual engineers should explore further.\nobjection (6): why think the importance of the revisionist project\nundermines the importance of the descriptive project? why think there’s\na tension between the two approaches? aren’t they complementary?\nthe objection: in section i of this chapter i described a tension between a descriptive\nproject and a revisionist project. but why aren’t they complementary projects? you\ncan do some describing and some amelioration, and these go hand in hand. moreover,\ni have described conceptual engineering as a two-step process: first describe\ndeficiencies and then develop ameliorative strategies. that first step is at least in part\ndescriptive,²² so the revisionist project presupposes the descriptive project. setting it\nup as a conflict is misleading.\nbefore replying to this objection, i should note that it contains an important\nelement of truth. there’s no inconsistency between the two projects; they could\n¹? none of this is to deny that you could just ignore topic continuity and describe properties independently\nof what ‘clusters’ or ‘neighbourhoods’ they belong to. nor is it to deny that having created the cluster,\nwe couldn’t then shift emphasis to one of the others (i.e., the anchoring doesn’t have to be continuous).\n²° see chapter 17 of my (2018) fixing language for more on this line of thought.\n²¹ for a paradigm of the kind of view i have in mind, see searle 1995: chapter 3. see also section 4.6 of\nbrian epstein’s stanford encyclopedia entry on social ontology (epstein 2018)) and the references in that\nentry.\n²² that it’s a defect is of course a normative judgement, but presumably that judgement relies on a\ndescription of what it is like (or what properties it has).\n \n \n \n '], [147, '147\ncomplement each other. despite this, i think it’s accurate to talk in somewhat loose\nterms about a ‘tension’ between the two projects. here is why:\nreply 1: the goals and purposes you have when doing research guides much of what\nyou do. for example, consider someone interested in how cells grow and divide as a\npurely intrinsically interesting topic. their research will be guided in very different\ndirections compared to someone who is interested in understanding cancer and is\ndoing the research in order to develop a cure for it. there’s obviously no incompatibility\nbetween the two projects, but the focus will be immensely influenced by the\ngoal. for a closer-to-home example, consider someone interested simply in the\nsyntax and semantics of ‘true’ compared to someone interested in ‘true’ because of\nthe semantic paradoxes. this will give rise to very different research projects and\nthere’s a tension in this sense: a lot of what the one is doing will be irrelevant to\nthe other because their research direction and priorities will differ significantly.\nor compare the following two: on the one hand, someone interested in the semantics\nand syntax of terms like ‘woman’, and on the other, someone like sally haslanger\nwho is interested in how such terms ought to be used to classify group for political\npurposes. again, there’s no incompatibility between the two projects, but the differences\nin goals will lead to difference in priorities and this again will shape radically\ndifferent research projects. however, none of this is to say that these differences in\ngoals, priorities and direction imply that the ameliorator shouldn’t in part be guided\nand restrained by descriptive insights.\nreply 2: what is impossible—or at least incompatible with the master argument—is\nto be a ‘pure’ descriptivist. a descriptivist who claims to have no interest in or need\nfor conceptual engineering shows a lack of understanding of the master argument.\na corollary of that argument is that all the concepts involved in describing conceptual\nengineering should themselves be subject to critical assessment. so should the\nconcepts used to describe and execute the descriptive project. we have to assess and\nimprove on the following concepts: ‘concept’, ‘conceptual defect’, ‘descriptive work’,\nand so on. in other words, the very terminology with which you engage in the\ndescriptive project is itself subject to assessment. so a ‘pure’ descriptivist would\nshow a lack of understanding for the need to assess and improve on the concepts\nused to engage in the descriptive project (and even the concepts involved in describing\nthe contrast between the descriptive and the ameliorative project).\nobjection (7): if we are to engage in conceptual engineering, don’twe have\nto assume that meaning assignments are within our control? if they are\nout of our control, how can we meaningfully engage in conceptual\nengineering?\nthe objection: setting up the objection will require slightly more work than in the\nprevious cases. here is the basic thought: conceptual engineering, i claim, involves\nidentifying representational defects and then finding ameliorative strategies. this\nseems to imply (or presuppose) that successful conceptual engineering requires that\nmeaning assignments are in large part within our control. why construct ameliorative\nstrategies if we can’t implement them?\n \n'], [148, '148\none reason i take this objection very seriously is that i think meaning assignments\nare in large part incomprehensible and outside human control. in what follows i first\nexplain why, and then reply to the objection.\nbackground for the objection: the metasemantic facts are out of control and inscrutable.\ni focus on what two broad kinds of metasemantic theories tell us about meaning\ndetermination: externalist theories and internalist theories. on the standard externalist\nstory, content determining factors include:\n• introductory events that typically happened long time ago and were performed\nby people we don’t know anything about. the introductory events will be of two\nbroad kinds: demonstrative (“let ‘f’ denote those kinds of things”) or descriptive\n(“let ‘f’ denote the things that are g”). note that if this is right, then in many\ncases the facts surrounding these introductory events will be unknowable to us.\nwe have no way to access what happened: there will be no written record and,\nabsent a time machine, we can’t know what happened. we don’t know what was\npointed to and we don’t know the details of the descriptions used. moreover, we\ndon’t know the motivations for these introductions.\n• externalist theories also appeal to chains of reference transition. in such communicative\nchains, expressions are ‘passed along’ from one speaker to another\nand there is some kind of reference-preserving element in the communicative\nchain. sometimes those chains are not reference preserving; in such cases, we get\nreference shifts.\n• other externalists, such as timothy williamson, talk more generally of meaning\nas supervening on use patterns over time where this connection between use and\nmeaning (or reference) is chaotic in the sense that there’s no algorithmthat takes\nus from use patterns to meanings. the connection is too complex—indeed it\nmight be in principle too complex for humans to grasp. we can’t know about all\nthe particular uses, and even if we did know about them, the way in which\nmeaning is generated by such use is too complex for the human mind to grasp.\nan important feature of these kinds of views is that we are in large part not in\ncontrol of the reference determining process. we’re not, for example, in control of\nwhat happened far into the past, we’re not in control of what happened in the\ntransition periods. in general, no one is in control of the total pattern of use. nor\nare we in control of the supervenience relation that takes us from complex usepatterns\nto meanings.\nit’s tempting to think that if your metasemantics is more internalistic, meanings\nwould be more within our control and so meaning change would be easier. burgess\nand plunkett, for example, say:\nthe textbook externalist thinks that our social and natural environments serve as heavy\nanchors, so to speak, for the interpretation of our individual thought and talk. the internalist,\nby contrast, grants us a greater degree of conceptual autonomy. one salient upshot of this\ndisagreement is that effecting conceptual change looks comparatively easy from an internalist\nperspective. we can revise, eliminate, or replace our concepts without worrying about what the\nexperts are up to, or what happens to be coming out of our taps.\n(burgess and plunkett 2013: 1096)\n \n'], [149, '149\ni agree with one part of this: from the point of view of an internalist theory, meaning\nchange and revision is possible. that’s all that’s needed to support the second\npremise in the master argument. however, and this will be relevant later,\ni disagree with the claim that internalism, as such, puts us more in control of these\nchanges. internalism is a supervenience claim: the extensions and intensions of\nexpressions supervene on individuals (and then lots of bells and whistles to\nelaborate on this in various ways, but the bells and whistles don’t matter right\nnow). suppose the meaning of my words supervene in that way on me. note first\nthat this is compatible with the meanings and extensions supervening on features of\nme that i have no control over. it’s also compatible with it being unsettled and\nunstable what combination of internal features ground reference. so there’s just no\nstep from internalism to control. moreover, even if meaning supervenes on something\ninternal that i have control over, control doesn’t follow: it could supervene on\nsomething we could control, but the determination relation from the supervenience\nbase to meanings/extension could still be out of our control. for example, even if\nthere’s supervenience on what we want or intend or decide, the supervenience\nrelation doesn’t have to make it the case that semantic values are what we intend\nfor them to be, what we want them to be, or what we agree on them to be (for all\nwe know, it could be a total mess or get us to the opposite of what we want, intend,\nor decide).\nin sum: both externalist and internalist theories makes meaning change possible,\nthough both of those theories make it hard to see how this is a process we can be in\ncontrol of. this is why objection (7) is pressing.\nreply: in summary form, my reply is that conceptual engineering shares this feature\nwith most normative theorizing. on the view i defend, the tools we think with are\noften defective, but there’s very little we can do about it. we can talk and think\nabout it, but doing so has hardly any effect. compare that to me talking to you\nabout crime in baltimore, poverty in bangladesh, or the trump presidency. such\ntalk is unlikely to have any effect on what happens in baltimore, bangladesh, or\ntrump. the ineffectiveness of talking is an almost universal aspect of large-scale\nnormative reflections. anyone who spends time thinking and talking about largescale\nnormative matters should do so without holding out too much hope that their\ntalking and thinking will have significant or predictable effects on the relevant\naspect of the world. if you think your views and theories about crime in baltimore,\npoverty in bangladesh, or the trump presidency will have a significant or predictable\neffect on either, you’re extremely likely to be disappointed (and to end up\nfeeling you’ve wasted the part of your life that has been devoted to these issues).\nthere are of course small-scale local issues where normative reflections will have a\ndirect effect. if i think my daughter shouldn’t have an ice cream, then, at least in a\nfew cases, the result will be that she eats no ice cream. moving to slightly largerscale\nissues—say speed bumps in the street where i live—my opinions, views, and\npleadings will have tiny effects, but already these effects will be fairly marginal,\nunsystematic, and unpredictable (as i’ve discovered). on the view proposed in\ncappelen (2018), changes in extensions and intensions of words are far over on\nthe large-scale and unpredictable side. much closer to crime in baltimore than to\n \n']]
